  abstract = {A novel probabilistic numerical method for quantifying the uncertainty induced by the time integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is introduced. Departing from the classical strategy to randomize ODE solvers by adding a random forcing term, we show that a probability measure over the numerical solution of ODEs can be obtained by introducing suitable random time-steps in a classical time integrator. This intrinsic randomization allows for the conservation of geometric properties of the underlying deterministic integrator such as mass conservation, symplecticity or conservation of first integrals. Weak and mean-square convergence analysis are derived. We also analyse the convergence of the Monte Carlo esti-mator for the proposed random time step method and show that the measure obtained with repeated sampling converges in the mean-square sense independently of the number of samples. Numerical examples including chaotic Hamiltonian systems, chemical reactions and Bayesian inferential problems illustrate the accuracy, robustness and versatility of our probabilistic numerical method.},

  abstract = {The recent statistical finite element method (statFEM) provides a coherent statistical framework to synthesise finite element models with observed data. Through embedding uncertainty inside of the governing equations, finite element solutions are updated to give a posterior distribution which quantifies all sources of uncertainty associated with the model. However to incorporate all sources of uncertainty, one must integrate over the uncertainty associated with the model parameters, the known forward problem of uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we make use of Langevin dynamics to solve the statFEM forward problem, studying the utility of the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA), a Metropolis-free Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, to build a sample-based characterisation of this otherwise intractable measure. Due to the structure of the statFEM problem, these methods are able to solve the forward problem without explicit full PDE solves, requiring only sparse matrix-vector products. ULA is also gradient-based, and hence provides a scalable approach up to high degrees-of-freedom. Leveraging the theory behind Langevin-based samplers, we provide theoretical guarantees on sampler performance, demonstrating convergence, for both the prior and posterior, in the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and, in Wasserstein-2, with further results on the effect of preconditioning. Numerical experiments are also provided, for both the prior and posterior, to demonstrate the efficacy of the sampler, with a Python package also included.},

  abstract = {Gradient adaptation is a useful technique for adjusting a set of parameters to minimize a cost function. While often easy to implement, the convergence speed of gradient adaptation can be slow when the slope of the cost function varies widely for small changes in the parameters. In this paper, we outline an alternative technique, termed natural gradient adaptation, that overcomes the poor convergence properties of gradient adaptation in many cases. The natural gradient is based on diierential geometry and employs knowledge of the Rieman-nian structure of the parameter space to adjust the gradient search direction. Unlike Newton's method, natural gradient adaptation does not assume a locally -quadratic cost function. Moreover, for maximum likelihood estimation tasks, natural gradient adaptation is asymptotically Fisher-eecient. A simple example illustrates the desirable properties of natural gradient adaptation.},

In contrast, the second one exploits the fitted orthogonal matrices, i.e., the rotational-based distance metric. Thanks to these distances, similarity-based techniques such as the multidimensional scaling method can be applied to visualize and explore patterns and similarities among observations. The proposed distances result in being helpful in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis. The brain activation measured over space and time can be represented by a matrix. The proposed distances applied to a sample of subjects -- i.e., matrices -- revealed groups of individuals sharing patterns of neural brain activation.},

The method consists of a Galerkin approximation in space and a collocation in the zeros of suitable tensor product orthogonal polynomials (Gauss points) in the probability space, and naturally leads to the solution of uncoupled deterministic problems as in the Monte Carlo approach. It treats easily a wide range of situations, such as input data that depend nonlinearly on the random variables, diffusivity coefficients with unbounded second moments, and random variables that are correlated or even unbounded. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis and demonstrate exponential convergence of the ``probability error'' with respect to the number of Gauss points in each direction of the probability space, under some regularity assumptions on the random input data. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of the method. Finally, we include a section with developments posterior to the original publication of this work. There we review sparse grid stochastic collocation methods, which are effective collocation strategies for problems that depend on a moderately large number of random variables.},

  abstract = {We present a general framework for hypothesis testing on distributions of sets of individual examples. Sets may represent many common data sources such as groups of observations in time series, collections of words in text or a batch of images of a given phenomenon. This observation pattern, however, differs from the common assumptions required for hypothesis testing: each set differs in size, may have differing levels of noise, and also may incorporate nuisance variability, irrelevant for the analysis of the phenomenon of interest; all features that bias test decisions if not accounted for. In this paper, we propose to interpret sets as independent samples from a collection of latent probability distributions, and introduce kernel two-sample and independence tests in this latent space of distributions. We prove the consistency of these tests and observe them to outperform in a wide range of synthetic experiments. Finally, we showcase their use in practice with experiments on healthcare and climate data, where previously heuristics were needed for feature extraction and testing.},

With this work, we aim to provide a collection of the essential facts and formulae on the geometry of the Grassmann manifold in a fashion that is fit for tackling the aforementioned problems with matrix-based algorithms. Moreover, we expose the Grassmann geometry both from the approach of representing subspaces with orthogonal projectors and when viewed as a quotient space of the orthogonal group, where subspaces are identified as equivalence classes of (orthogonal) bases. This bridges the associated research tracks and allows for an easy transition between these two approaches. Original contributions include a modified algorithm for computing the Riemannian logarithm map on the Grassmannian that is advantageous numerically but also allows for a more elementary, yet more complete description of the cut locus and the conjugate points. We also derive a formula for parallel transport along geodesics in the orthogonal projector perspective, formulae for the derivative of the exponential map, as well as a formula for Jacobi fields vanishing at one point.},

Special attention is paid to the development of techniques which, although not global, are less sensitive to initial parameter estimates than the standard approach employing the sensitivity equations. Experience indicates that interactive approaches can be very valuable when good starting parameter approximations are unavailable. We describe the main features of our interactive parameter fitting package PARFIT. This package contains standard techniques employing the sensitivity equations as well as special algorithms designed to improve poor parameter estimates. These special algorithms have been selected and developed with user interaction in mind. We describe in detail one special approach designed for the case when observations are not available on all state variables. An example (using computer generated observations) is presented to illustrate this approach.

  abstract = {The use of models to try to better understand reality is ubiquitous. Models have proven useful in testing our current understanding of reality; for instance, climate models of the 1980s were built for science discovery, to achieve a better understanding of the general dynamics of climate systems. Scientific insights often take the form of general qualitative predictions (i.e.,``under these conditions, the Earth's poles will warm more than the rest of the planet''); such use of models differs from making quantitative forecasts of specific events (i.e. ``high winds at noon tomorrow at London's Heathrow Airport''). It is sometimes hoped that, after sufficient model development, any model can be used to make quantitative forecasts for any target system. Even if that were the case, there would always be some uncertainty in the prediction. Uncertainty quantification aims to provide a framework within which that uncertainty can be discussed and, ideally, quantified, in a manner relevant to practitioners using the forecast system. A statistical formalism has developed that claims to be able to accurately assess the uncertainty in prediction. This article is a discussion of if and when this formalism can do so. The article arose from an ongoing discussion between the authors concerning this issue, the second author generally being considerably more skeptical concerning the utility of the formalism in providing quantitative decision-relevant information.},

More precisely, the proposed definition concerns those statistical problems where the sample data are real functions defined on a compact interval of the real line. The obvious difficulty for such a functional extension is the non-invertibility of the covariance operator in infinite-dimensional cases. Unlike other recent proposals, our definition is suggested and motivated in terms of the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) associated with the stochastic process that generates the data. The proposed distance is a true metric; it depends on a unique real smoothing parameter which is fully motivated in RKHS terms. Moreover, it shares some properties of its finite dimensional counterpart: it is invariant under isometries, it can be consistently estimated from the data and its sampling distribution is known under Gaussian models. An empirical study for two statistical applications, outliers detection and binary classification, is included. The obtained results are quite competitive when compared to other recent proposals of the literature.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inverse problems often involve sampling posterior distributions on infinite-dimensional function spaces. Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are characterized by deteriorating mixing times upon mesh-refinement, when the finite-dimensional approximations become more accurate. Such methods are typically forced to reduce step-sizes as the discretization gets finer, and thus are expensive as a function of dimension. Recently, a new class of MCMC methods with mesh-independent convergence times has emerged. However , few of them take into account the geometry of the posterior informed by the data. At the same time, recently developed geometric MCMC algorithms have been found to be powerful in exploring complicated distributions that deviate significantly from elliptic Gaussian laws, but are in general computationally intractable for models defined in infinite dimensions. In this work, we combine geometric methods on a finite-dimensional subspace with mesh-independent infinite-dimensional approaches. Our objective is to speed up MCMC mixing times, without significantly increasing the computational cost per step (for instance, in comparison with the vanilla preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) method). This is achieved by using ideas from geometric MCMC to probe the complex structure of an intrinsic finite-dimensional subspace where most data information concentrates, while retaining robust mixing times as the dimension grows by using pCN-like methods in the complementary subspace. The resulting algorithms are demonstrated in the context of three challenging inverse problems arising in subsurface flow, heat conduction and incompressible flow control. The algorithms exhibit up to two orders of magnitude improvement in sampling efficiency when compared with the pCN method.},

Our contraction results only require a prior mass condition on certain Kullback\textendash Leibler (KL) neighborhood of the true parameter (or the KL divergence minimizer in the misspecified case), and obviate constructions of test functions and sieves commonly used in the literature for analyzing the contraction property of a regular posterior. We show through a counterexample that some condition controlling the complexity of the parameter space is necessary for the regular posterior to contract, rendering additional flexibility on the choice of the prior for the fractional posterior. Second, we derive a novel Bayesian oracle inequality based on a PAC-Bayes inequality in misspecified models. Our derivation reveals several advantages of averaging based Bayesian procedures over optimization based frequentist procedures. As an application of the Bayesian oracle inequality, we derive a sharp oracle inequality in multivariate convex regression problems. We also illustrate the theory in Gaussian process regression and density estimation problems.},

The utility of these methods is frequently demonstrated on pathological examples using simulated data generated from a known model with a random error component and a known statistical distribution. Unfortunately, parameter estimation problems encountered in practice do not have this advantage. The true model is frequently not known. In fact, one is faced with choosing among various candidate models, all of which may be wrong. Moreover, the error structure is generally unknown and must be estimated from the data. Finally, a great deal of mathematical expertise is required to transform the model and select meaningful starting guesses before parameter estimation can be successful. In order to demonstrate the difficulties of parameter estimation in the industrial environment and the limitations of existing methods, a parameter estimation problem formulated by the Dow Chemical Company is presented and solved. This test problem consists of a stiff differential/algebraic (DAE) model that describes complex kinetics and requires the estimation of nine parameters from batch reactor data. Here the model was inadequate to describe the data, the error structure was not specified and the starting guesses led to a nontrivial optimization problem. The Dow parameter estimation problem was distributed in 1981 to 165 researchers as a followup to the 1980 FOCAPD conference. Of those researchers, eleven agreed to apply their methodologies and expertise to this problem. However, only five acceptable solutions were finally submitted. Here we present and compare these results. Each solution was obtained using different strategies. In most cases the form of the model was also changed to accommodate the algorithms used and to ease the solution procedure. Therefore, while this case study does not present a direct numerical comparison of algorithms, it does offer guidelines and insight towards the solution of difficult parameter estimation problems.},

In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.},

Often the adjoint method is used in an application without explanation. The purpose of this tuto-rial is to explain the method in detail in a general setting that is kept as simple as possible. We use the following notation: the total derivative (gradient) is denoted d x (usually denoted d({$\cdot$})/dx or x); the partial derivative, {$\partial$} x (usually, {$\partial$}({$\cdot$})/{$\partial$} x); the differential, d. We also use the notation f x for both partial and total derivatives when we think the meaning is clear from context. Recall that a gradient is a row vector, and this convention induces sizing conventions for the other operators. We use only real numbers in this presentation.},

This raises several statistical challenges, including the design of statistical methods that enable the coherent propagation of probabilities through a (possibly deterministic) computational work-flow, in order to assess the impact of discretisation error on the computer output. This paper examines the case for probabilistic numerical methods in routine statistical computation. Our focus is on numerical integration, where a probabilistic integrator is equipped with a full distribution over its output that reflects the fact that the integrand has been discretised. Our main technical contribution is to establish, for the first time, rates of posterior contraction for one such method. Several substantial applications are provided for illustration and critical evaluation, including examples from statistical modelling, computer graphics and a computer model for an oil reservoir.},

In this work, we study a class of minimum distance estima-tors for intractable generative models, that is, statistical models for which the likelihood is intractable, but simulation is cheap. The distance considered, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), is defined through the embedding of probability measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We study the theoretical properties of these estimators, showing that they are consistent, asymptotically normal and robust to model misspecification. A main advantage of these estimators is the flexibility offered by the choice of kernel, which can be used to trade-off statistical efficiency and robustness. On the algorithmic side, we study the geometry induced by MMD on the parameter space and use this to introduce a novel natural gradient descent-like algorithm for efficient implementation of these estimators. We illustrate the relevance of our theoretical results on several classes of models including a discrete-time latent Markov process and two multivariate stochastic differential equation models.},

We adopt the Bayesian inference formulation: given observational data and their uncertainty, the governing forward problem and its uncertainty, and a prior probability distribution describing uncertainty in the parameter field, find the posterior probability distribution over the parameter field. The prior must be chosen appropriately in order to guarantee well-posedness of the infinite-dimensional inverse problem and facilitate computation of the posterior. Furthermore, straightforward discretizations may not lead to convergent approximations of the infinite-dimensional problem. And finally, solution of the discretized inverse problem via explicit construction of the covariance matrix is prohibitive due to the need to solve the forward problem as many times as there are parameters. Our computational framework builds on the infinite-dimensional formulation proposed by Stuart [Acta Numer., 19 (2010), pp. 451-559] and incorporates a number of components aimed at ensuring a convergent discretization of the underlying infinite-dimensional inverse problem. The framework additionally incorporates algorithms for manipulating the prior, constructing a low rank approximation of the data-informed component of the posterior covariance operator, and exploring the posterior that together ensure scalability of the entire framework to very high parameter dimensions. We demonstrate this computational framework on the Bayesian solution of an inverse problem in three-dimensional global seismic wave propagation with hundreds of thousands of parameters.Copyright \textcopyright{} by SIAM.},

The small number of existing approaches either use suboptimal hand-crafted heuristics for hyperparameter learning, or suffer from catastrophic forgetting or slow updating when new data arrive. This paper develops a new principled framework for deploying Gaussian process probabilistic models in the streaming setting, providing methods for learning hyperparameters and optimising pseudo-input locations.

  abstract = {Change point detection is an important part of time series analysis, as the presence of a change point indicates an abrupt and significant change in the data generating process. While many algorithms for change point detection exist, little attention has been paid to evaluating their performance on real-world time series. Algorithms are typically evaluated on simulated data and a small number of commonly-used series with unreliable ground truth. Clearly this does not provide sufficient insight into the comparative performance of these algorithms. Therefore, instead of developing yet another change point detection method, we consider it vastly more important to properly evaluate existing algorithms on real-world data. To achieve this, we present the first data set specifically designed for the evaluation of change point detection algorithms, consisting of 37 time series from various domains. Each time series was annotated by five expert human annotators to provide ground truth on the presence and location of change points. We analyze the consistency of the human annotators, and describe evaluation metrics that can be used to measure algorithm performance in the presence of multiple ground truth annotations. Subsequently, we present a benchmark study where 14 existing algorithms are evaluated on each of the time series in the data set. This study shows that binary segmentation (Scott and Knott, 1974) and Bayesian online change point detection (Adams and MacKay, 2007) are among the best performing methods. Our aim is that this data set will serve as a proving ground in the development of novel change point detection algorithms.},

In this work, we highlight some advantages and limitations of employing the Kullback-Leibler divergence in this setting. For example, we show that minimizing the KL divergence between a wide class of parametric distributions and the posterior induced by a (non-degenerate) Gaussian process prior leads to an ill-defined objective function. Then, we propose (featurized) Bayesian linear regression as a benchmark for `function-space' inference methods that directly measures approximation quality. We apply this methodology to assess aspects of the objective function and inference scheme considered in Sun, Zhang, Shi, and Grosse (2018), emphasizing the quality of approximation to Bayesian inference as opposed to predictive performance.},

In the case of ODEs, this dependence is due to having to interrupt the computation at each observation point during numerical solution of the adjoint equations. Each observation introduces a jump discontinuity in the solution of the adjoint differential equations. These discontinuities are propagated in the case of DDEs, making the performance of the adjoint approach even more sensitive to the number of observations for DDEs. We quantify this cost and suggest ways to make the adjoint approach scale better with the number of observations.

This particle filter type algorithm has a computational complexity which scales linearly both in the number of data and the number of particles.

Calculations derived in the present section are formal. The final computational method obtained is the so-called 4D-var algorithms. Few variants of the so-called "4D-var" algorithms are presented (3D-var, incremental method). Few examples from recent research studies in fluid mechanics (shallow-water model) and in geophysics are presented. Finally, in the linear case (the forward model is linear), the equivalency between the Best Linear Unbiassed Estimate (BLUE) and the variational optimal solution is shown. 4.1 Introduction Data assimilation is the science combining "at best" the three knowledges of a system: the model (mathematical equations), the reality (observations-measurements) and some statistical errors (errors of measurements, model errors). Data assimilation refers to two different (and complimentary) approaches: 1) filtering such as the Kalman's filter (roughly, we calculate the Best Linear Unbiased Estimate-BLUE-using algebric calculations) or the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). It is stochastic methods. 2) variational data assimilation based on the present control theory. It is more deterministic methods, even if one can introduce statistical errors too. The basic principle is to minimize a cost function which measures the misfit between the output of the model and the measurements. Both approaches lead to the same estimate in the linear case. At the end of the chapter, we show the equivalency between the (basic) Best Linear Unbiased Estimate (BLUE) and the 53},

Accounting for this uncertainty can avoid posterior under-coverage when likelihoods are constructed from a coarsely discretized approximation to system equations. A formalism is proposed for inferring a fixed but a priori unknown model trajectory through Bayesian updating of a prior process conditional on model information. A one-step-ahead sampling scheme for interrogating the model is described, its consistency and first order convergence properties are proved, and its computational complexity is shown to be proportional to that of numerical explicit one-step solvers. Examples illustrate the flexibility of this framework to deal with a wide variety of complex and large-scale systems. Within the calibration problem, discretization uncertainty defines a layer in the Bayesian hierarchy, and a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that targets this posterior distribution is presented. This formalism is used for inference on the JAK-STAT delay differential equation model of protein dynamics from indirectly observed measurements. The discussion outlines implications for the new field of probabilistic numerics.},

We review and illustrate a simple data assimilation framework for calibrating mathematical models based on ordinary differential equation models using time series data describing the temporal progression of case counts relating, for instance, to population growth or infectious disease transmission dynamics. In contrast to Bayesian estimation approaches that always raise the question of how to set priors for the parameters, this frequentist approach relies on modeling the error structure in the data. We discuss issues related to parameter identifiability, uncertainty quantification and propagation as well as model performance and forecasts along examples based on phenomenological and mechanistic models parameterized using simulated and real datasets.},

This paper establishes Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods as those which can be cast as solutions to certain inverse problems within the Bayesian framework. This allows us to establish general conditions under which Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods are well-defined, encompassing both non-linear and non-Gaussian models. For general computation, a numerical approximation scheme is proposed and its asymptotic convergence established. The theoretical development is then extended to pipelines of computation, wherein probabilistic numerical methods are composed to solve more challenging numerical tasks. The contribution highlights an important research frontier at the interface of numerical analysis and uncertainty quantification, with a challenging industrial application presented.},

  abstract = {Calibration of large-scale differential equation models to observational or experimental data is a widespread challenge throughout applied sciences and engineering. A crucial bottleneck in state-of-the art calibration methods is the calculation of local sensitivities, i.e. derivatives of the loss function with respect to the estimated parameters, which often necessitates several numerical solves of the underlying system of partial or ordinary differential equations. In this paper we present a new probabilistic approach to computing local sensitivities. The proposed method has several advantages over classical methods. Firstly, it operates within a constrained computational budget and provides a probabilistic quantification of uncertainty incurred in the sensitivities from this constraint. Secondly, information from previous sensitivity estimates can be recycled in subsequent computations, reducing the overall computational effort for iterative gradient-based calibration methods. The methodology presented is applied to two challenging test problems and compared against classical methods.},

In particular, the approach confers robustness to failure of the numerical PDE solver, with statistical inferences driven to be more conservative in the presence of substantial discretisation error. Going further, the problem of choosing a PDE solver is cast as a problem in the Bayesian design of experiments, where the aim is to minimise the impact of solver error on statistical inferences; here the challenge of non-linear PDEs is also considered. The method is applied to parameter inference problems in which discretisation error in non-negligible and must be accounted for in order to reach conclusions that are statistically valid.},

Bayesian inference is a prime example of such a procedure but one can also construct other learning procedures that return distributional output. This paper studies conditions for a learning procedure to be considered calibrated, in the sense that the true data-generating parameters are plausible as samples from its distributional output. A learning procedure that is calibrated need not be statistically efficient and vice versa. A hypothesis-testing framework is developed in order to assess, using simulation, whether a learning procedure is calibrated. Finally, we exploit our framework to test the calibration of some learning procedures that are motivated as being approximations to Bayesian inference but are nevertheless widely used.},

Equivariant networks have shown excellent performance and data efficiency on vision and medical imaging problems that exhibit symmetries. Here we show how this principle can be extended beyond global symmetries to local gauge transformations. This enables the development of a very general class of convolutional neural networks on manifolds that depend only on the intrinsic geometry, and which includes many popular methods from equivariant and geometric deep learning. We implement gauge equivariant CNNs for signals defined on the surface of the icosahedron, which provides a reasonable approximation of the sphere. By choosing to work with this very regular manifold, we are able to implement the gauge equivariant convolution using a single conv2d call, making it a highly scalable and practical alternative to Spherical CNNs. Using this method, we demonstrate substantial improvements over previous methods on the task of segmenting omnidirectional images and global climate patterns.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a formal quantification of uncertainty induced by numerical solutions of ordinary and partial differential equation models. Numerical solutions of differential equations contain inherent uncertainties due to the finite-dimensional approximation of an unknown and implicitly defined function. When statistically analysing models based on differential equations describing physical, or other naturally occurring, phenomena, it can be important to explicitly account for the uncertainty introduced by the numerical method. Doing so enables objective determination of this source of uncertainty, relative to other uncertainties, such as those caused by data contaminated with noise or model error induced by missing physical or inadequate descriptors. As ever larger scale mathematical models are being used in the sciences, often sacrificing complete resolution of the differential equation on the grids used, formally accounting for the uncertainty in the numerical method is becoming increasingly more important. This paper provides the formal means to incorporate this uncer-Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (tainty in a statistical model and its subsequent analysis. We show that a wide variety of existing solvers can be randomised, inducing a probability measure over the solutions of such differential equations. These measures exhibit contraction to a Dirac measure around the true unknown solution , where the rates of convergence are consistent with the underlying deterministic numerical method. Furthermore, we employ the method of modified equations to demonstrate enhanced rates of convergence to stochastic perturbations of the original deterministic problem. Ordinary differential equations and elliptic partial differential equations are used to illustrate the approach to quantify uncertainty in both the statistical analysis of the forward and inverse problems.},

  abstract = {High accuracy complex computer models, also called simulators, require large resources in time and memory to produce realistic results. Statistical emulators are computationally cheap approximations of such simulators. They can be built to replace simulators for various purposes, such as the propagation of uncertainties from inputs to outputs or the calibration of some internal parameters against observations. However, when the input space is of high dimension, the construction of an emulator can become prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we introduce a joint framework merging emulation with dimension reduction in order to overcome this hurdle. The gradient-based kernel dimension reduction technique is chosen due to its ability to drastically decrease dimensionality with little loss in information. The Gaussian process emulation technique is combined with this dimension reduction approach. Theoretical properties of the approximation are explored. Our proposed approach provides an answer to the dimension reduction issue in emulation for a wide range of simulation problems that cannot be tackled using existing methods. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed framework is demonstrated theoretically and compared with other methods on an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) problem. We finally present a realistic application to tsunami modeling. The uncertainties in the bathymetry (seafloor elevation) are modeled as high-dimensional realizations of a spatial process using a geostatistical approach. Our dimension-reduced emulation enables us to compute the impact of these uncertainties on resulting possible tsunami wave heights near-shore and on-shore. Considering an uncertain earthquake source, we observe a significant increase in the spread of uncertainties in the tsunami heights due to the contribution of the bathymetry uncertainties to the overall uncertainty budget. These results highlight the need to include the effect of uncertainties in the bathymetry in tsunami early warnings and risk assessments.},

The key components of active subspace methods are the eigenvectors of a symmetric, positive semidefinite matrix whose elements are the average products of partial derivatives of the simulation's input/output map. We study a Monte Carlo method for approximating the eigenpairs of this matrix. We offer both theoretical results based on recent non-asymptotic random matrix theory and a practical approach based on the bootstrap. We extend the analysis to the case when the gradients are approximated, for example, with finite differences. Our goal is to provide guidance for two questions that arise in active subspaces: (i) How many gradient samples does one need to accurately approximate the eigenvalues and subspaces? (ii) What can be said about the accuracy of the estimated subspace, both theoretically and practically? We test the approach on both simple quadratic functions where the active subspace is known and a parameterized PDE with 100 variables characterizing the coefficients of the differential operator.},

  abstract = {Response surfaces are common surrogates for expensive computer simulations in engineering analysis. However, the cost of fitting an accurate response surface increases exponentially as the number of model inputs increases, which leaves response surface construction intractable for high-dimensional, nonlinear models. We describe ridge approximation for fitting response surfaces in several variables. A ridge function is constant along several directions in its domain, so fitting occurs on the coordinates of a low-dimensional subspace of the input space. We review essential theory for ridge approximation---e.g., the best mean-squared approximation and an optimal low-dimensional subspace---and we prove that the gradient-based active subspace is near-stationary for the least-squares problem that defines an optimal subspace. Motivated by the theory, we propose a computational heuristic that uses an estimated active subspace as an initial guess for a ridge approximation fitting problem. We show a simple example where the heuristic fails, which reveals a type of function for which the proposed approach is inappropriate. We then propose a simple alternating heuristic for fitting a ridge function, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the active subspace initial guess applied to an airfoil model of drag as a function of its 18 shape parameters.},

  abstract = {In this paper we establish a mathematical framework for a range of inverse problems for functions, given a finite set of noisy observations. The problems are hence underdetermined and are often ill-posed. We study these problems from the viewpoint of Bayesian statistics, with the resulting posterior probability measure being defined on a space of functions. We develop an abstract framework for such problems which facilitates application of an infinite-dimensional version of Bayes theorem, leads to a well-posedness result for the posterior measure (continuity in a suitable probability metric with respect to changes in data), and also leads to a theory for the existence of maximizing the posterior probability (MAP) estimators for such Bayesian inverse problems on function space. A central idea underlying these results is that continuity properties and bounds on the forward model guide the choice of the prior measure for the inverse problem, leading to the desired results on well-posedness and MAP estimators; the PDE analysis and probability theory required are thus clearly dileneated, allowing a straightforward derivation of results. We show that the abstract theory applies to some concrete applications of interest by studying problems arising from data assimilation in fluid mechanics. The objective is to make inference about the underlying velocity field, on the basis of either Eulerian or Lagrangian observations. We study problems without model error, in which case the inference is on the initial condition, and problems with model error in which case the inference is on the initial condition and on the driving noise process or, equivalently, on the entire time-dependent velocity field. In order to undertake a relatively uncluttered mathematical analysis we consider the two-dimensional Navier\textendash Stokes equation on a torus. The case of Eulerian observations\textemdash direct observations of the velocity field itself\textemdash is then a model for weather forecasting. The case of Lagrangian observations\textemdash observations of passive tracers advected by the flow\textemdash is then a model for data arising in oceanography. The methodology which we describe herein may be applied to many other inverse problems in which it is of interest to find, given observations, an infinite-dimensional object, such as the initial condition for a PDE. A similar approach might be adopted, for example, to determine an appropriate mathematical setting for the inverse problem of determining an unknown tensor arising in a constitutive law for a PDE, given observations of the solution. The paper is structured so that the abstract theory can be read independently of the particular problems in fluid mechanics which are subsequently studied by application of the theory.},

  abstract = {Bayes classifiers for functional data pose a challenge. This is because probability density functions do not exist for functional data. As a consequence, the classical Bayes classifier using density quotients needs to be modified. We propose to use density ratios of projections on a sequence of eigenfunctions that are common to the groups to be classified. The density ratios can then be factored into density ratios of individual functional principal components whence the classification problem is reduced to a sequence of nonparametric one-dimensional density estimates. This is an extension to functional data of some of the very earliest nonparametric Bayes classifiers that were based on simple density ratios in the one-dimensional case. By means of the factorization of the density quotients the curse of dimensionality that would otherwise severely affect Bayes classifiers for functional data can be avoided. We demonstrate that in the case of Gaussian functional data, the proposed functional Bayes classifier reduces to a functional version of the classical quadratic discriminant. A study of the asymptotic behavior of the proposed classifiers in the large sample limit shows that under certain conditions the misclassification rate converges to zero, a phenomenon that has been referred to as ``perfect classification''. The proposed classifiers also perform favorably in finite sample applications, as we demonstrate in comparisons with other functional classifiers in simulations and various data applications, including wine spectral data, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients, and yeast gene expression data.},

  abstract = {Change point detection (CPD) aims to locate abrupt property changes in time series data. Recent CPD methods demonstrated the potential of using deep learning techniques, but often lack the ability to identify more subtle changes in the autocorrelation statistics of the signal and suffer from a high false alarm rate. To address these issues, we employ an autoencoderbased methodology with a novel loss function, through which the used autoencoders learn a partially time-invariant representation that is tailored for CPD. The result is a flexible method that allows the user to indicate whether change points should be sought in the time domain, frequency domain or both. Detectable change points include abrupt changes in the slope, mean, variance, autocorrelation function and frequency spectrum. We demonstrate that our proposed method is consistently highly competitive or superior to baseline methods on diverse simulated and real-life benchmark data sets. Finally, we mitigate the issue of false detection alarms through the use of a postprocessing procedure that combines a matched filter and a newly proposed change point score. We show that this combination drastically improves the performance of our method as well as all baseline methods.},

We consider the case where no accurate nor tractable model can be found, using a model-free approach, called Kernel change detection (KCD). KCD compares two sets of descriptors extracted online from the signal at each time instant: the immediate past set and the immediate future set. Based on the soft margin single-class Support Vector Machine (SVM), we build a dissimilarity measure in feature space between those sets, without estimating densities as an intermediary step. This dissimilarity measure is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the Fisher ratio in the Gaussian case. Implementation issues are addressed, in particular, the dissimilarity measure can be computed online in input space. Simulation results on both synthetic signals and real music signals show the efficiency of KCD.},

Their parameters are estimated on approximate models, whose regression functions are evaluated by a numerical integration method. Accurate and efficient estimations of these parameters are critical issues. This paper proposes parameter estimation methods involving either a stochastic approximation EM algorithm (SAEM) in the maximum likelihood estimation, or a Gibbs sampler in the Bayesian approach. Both algorithms involve the simulation of non-observed data with conditional distributions using Hastings-Metropolis (H-M) algorithms. A modified H-M algorithm, including an original local linearization scheme to solve the ODEs, is proposed to reduce the computational time significantly. The convergence on the approximate model of all these algorithms is proved. The errors induced by the numerical solving method on the conditional distribution, the likelihood and the posterior distribution are bounded. The Bayesian and maximum likelihood estimation methods are illustrated on a simulated pharmacokinetic nonlinear mixed-effects model defined by an ODE. Simulation results illustrate the ability of these algorithms to provide accurate estimates. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {We present a statistical finite element method for nonlinear, time-dependent phenomena, illustrated in the context of nonlinear internal waves (solitons). We take a Bayesian approach and leverage the finite element method to cast the statistical problem as a nonlinear Gaussian state-space model, updating the solution, in receipt of data, in a filtering framework. The method is applicable to problems across science and engineering for which finite element methods are appropriate. The Korteweg-de Vries equation for solitons is presented because it reflects the necessary complexity while being suitably familiar and succinct for peda-gogical purposes. We present two algorithms to implement this method, based on the extended and ensemble Kalman filters, and demonstrate effectiveness with a simulation study and a case study with experimental data. The generality of our approach is demonstrated in SI Appendix, where we present examples from additional nonlinear, time-dependent partial differential equations (Burgers equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation). Bayesian calibration | finite element methods | model discrepancy T he central role of physically derived, nonlinear, time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) in scientific and engineering research is undisputed, as is the need for numerical intervention in order to understand their behavior. The finite element method (FEM) has emerged as the foremost strategy to undergo this numerical intervention, yet when these discretized solutions are compared with empirical evidence, elements of model mismatch are revealed that require statistical formalisms to be dealt with appropriately (1-3). To address this problem of model misspecification, in this paper we introduce stochas-tic forcing inside the PDE and update the FEM discretized PDE solution with data in a filtering context. Stochastic forcing is introduced through a random function within the governing equations. This represents an unknown process , which may have been omitted in the formulation of the physical model. For an elliptic linear PDE with coefficients {$\Lambda$}, this can be expressed as L{$\Lambda$}u = f + {$\xi$} \$\th eta\$ , {$\xi$} \$\th eta\$ {$\sim$} GP(0, C \$\th eta\$), u := u(x), f := f (x), x {$\in$} {$\Omega$} {$\subset$} R d. The push forward of the Gaussian random field {$\xi$} \$\th eta\$ , with covari-ance parameters \$\th eta\$, induces a probability measure over the space of admissible solutions to the above. To embed this into a finite element model, we start with the weak form A{$\Lambda$}(u, v) = f , v , +{$\xi$} \$\th eta\$ , v , where A{$\Lambda$}({$\cdot$}, {$\cdot$}) is the bilinear form generated from L{$\Lambda$} and {$\cdot$}, {$\cdot\cdot$} is the appropriate Hilbert space inner product. Discretizing with finite elements u(x) = M i=1 ui {$\phi$}i (x), v (x) = M i=1 vi {$\phi$}i (x) yields the Gaussian measure over the solution FEM coefficients u = (u1, u2,. .. , uM) {$\in$} R M : p(u | {$\Lambda$}, \$\th eta\$) = N (A -1 b, A -1 G(\$\th eta\$)A -T), where Aij = A{$\Lambda$}({$\phi$}i , {$\phi$}j), bi = f , {$\phi$}i , and G(\$\th eta\$)ij = {$\phi$}i , C \$\th eta\$ {$\phi$}j. This defines a (finite-dimensional) prior distribution over the FEM model, which represents all assumed knowledge before observing data. The mean is the standard Galerkin solution, and the covariance results from the action of the discretized PDE operator on the covariance G(\$\th eta\$); further details are contained in SI Appendix, section 1. This was first developed in ref. 4, and we demonstrate the generality of such an approach by extending it to nonlinear, time-dependent PDEs. An area in which nonlinear and time-dependent problems are ubiquitous is ocean dynamic processes, where essentially all problems stem from a governing system of nonlinear, time-dependent equations (e.g., the Navier-Stokes equations). The ocean dynamics community has grown increasingly cognizant of the importance of accurate uncertainty quantification (5, 6), with many possible applications [e.g., rogue waves (7), turbulent flow (8)] for our proposed methodology. An example process is nonlinear internal waves (solitons), which are observed as waves of depression or elevation along a pycnocline in a density-stratified fluid and are of broad interest to both the scientific and engineering communities (9-13). The classical mathematical model for solitons is the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation (14): ut + {$\alpha$}uux + {$\beta$}uxxx + cux = 0, u := u(x , t), x {$\in$} [0, L], t {$\in$} [0, T ], [1] where u is the pycnocline displacement. Coefficients {$\alpha$}, {$\beta$}, and c are determined by physical parameters. Eq. 1 is readily inter-pretable: waves propagate at wave speed c, nonlinear steepening results from uux , and dispersion is due to uxxx. Relative coefficient values determine the dominating regime, and waves can vary from quasilinear to highly nonlinear. Significance Science and engineering have benefited greatly from the ability of finite element methods (FEMs) to simulate nonlinear, time-dependent complex systems. The recent advent of extensive data collection from such complex systems now raises the question of how to systematically incorporate these data into finite element models, consistently updating the solution in the face of mathematical model misspecification with physical reality. This article describes general and widely applicable methodology for the coherent synthesis of data with FEM models, providing a data-driven probability distribution that captures all sources of uncertainty in the pairing of FEM with measurements.},

It offers a comprehensive survey of modern techniques in the theoretical study of PDE with particular emphasis on nonlinear equations. Its wide scope and clear exposition make it a great text for a graduate course in PDE. For this edition, the author has made numerous changes, including a new chapter on nonlinear wave equations, more than 80 new exercises, several new sections, a significantly expanded bibliography.  About the First Edition: I have used this book for both regular PDE and topics courses. It has a wonderful combination of insight and technical detail...Evans' book is evidence of his mastering of the field and the clarity of presentation (Luis Caffarelli, University of Texas) It is fun to teach from Evans' book. It explains many of the essential ideas and techniques of partial differential equations ...Every graduate student in analysis should read it. (David Jerison, MIT) I use Partial Differential Equations to prepare my students for their Topic exam, which is a requirement before starting working on their dissertation. The book provides an excellent account of PDE's ...I am very happy with the preparation it provides my students. (Carlos Kenig, University of Chicago) Evans' book has already attained the status of a classic. It is a clear choice for students just learning the subject, as well as for experts who wish to broaden their knowledge ...An outstanding reference for many aspects of the field.

The computational complexity of the approach is quadratic in the number of observations, but an approximate version, which introduces negligible error, and whose computational cost is roughly linear in the number of observations, is also possible. Our approach can be useful, for example within an MCMC algorithm, even when the independence assumptions do not hold. We demonstrate our approach on coal-mining disaster data and on well-log data. Our method can cope with a range of models, and exact simulation from the posterior distribution is possible in a matter of minutes.},

One, a version of rejection control, allows the particle filter to automatically choose the number of particles required at each time-step.

  abstract = {Kernel methods are one of the mainstays of machine learning, but the problem of kernel learning remains challenging, with only a few heuris-tics and very little theory. This is of particular importance in methods based on estimation of kernel mean embeddings of probability measures. For characteristic kernels, which include most commonly used ones, the kernel mean embedding uniquely determines its probability measure , so it can be used to design a powerful statistical testing framework, which includes non-parametric two-sample and independence tests. In practice, however, the performance of these tests can be very sensitive to the choice of kernel and its lengthscale parameters. To address this central issue, we propose a new probabilistic model for kernel mean embeddings, the Bayesian Kernel Embedding model, combining a Gaus-sian process prior over the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space containing the mean embedding with a conjugate likelihood function, thus yielding a closed form posterior over the mean embedding. The posterior mean of our model is closely related to recently proposed shrinkage es-timators for kernel mean embeddings, while the posterior uncertainty is a new, interesting feature with various possible applications. Critically for the purposes of kernel learning, our model gives a simple, closed form marginal pseudolikelihood of the observed data given the kernel hyperpa-rameters. This marginal pseudolikelihood can either be optimized to inform the hyperparameter choice or fully Bayesian inference can be used.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization is an approach to optimizing objective functions that take a long time (minutes or hours) to evaluate. It is best-suited for optimization over continuous domains of less than 20 dimensions, and tolerates stochastic noise in function evaluations. It builds a surrogate for the objective and quantifies the uncertainty in that surrogate using a Bayesian machine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, and then uses an acquisition function defined from this surrogate to decide where to sample. In this tutorial, we describe how Bayesian optimization works, including Gaussian process regression and three common acquisition functions: expected improvement, entropy search, and knowledge gradient. We then discuss more advanced techniques, including running multiple function evaluations in parallel, multi-fidelity and multi-information source optimization, expensive-to-evaluate constraints, random environmental conditions, multi-task Bayesian optimization, and the inclusion of derivative information. We conclude with a discussion of Bayesian optimization software and future research directions in the field. Within our tutorial material we provide a generalization of expected improvement to noisy evaluations, beyond the noise-free setting where it is more commonly applied. This generalization is justified by a formal decision-theoretic argument, standing in contrast to previous ad hoc modifications.},

If parameters are inferred from experimental data, such mechanistic models can provide accurate predictions about the behavior of latent variables or the process under new experimental conditions. Complementarily, inference of model structure can be used to identify the most plausible model structure from a set of candidates, and, thus, gain novel biological insight. Several toolboxes can infer model parameters and structure for small-to medium-scale mechanistic models out of the box. However, models for highly multiplexed datasets can require hundreds to thousands of state variables and parameters. For the analysis of such large-scale models, most algorithms require intractably high computation times.

Monte Carlo simulation is an effective technique, especially with complex and high-dimensional models. This paper aims to bring to the attention of general statistical audiences of some effective methods originating from theoretical physics and at the same time to explore these methods from a more statistical perspective, through establishing theoretical connections and illustrating their uses with statistical problems. We show that the acceptance ratio method and thermodynamic integration are natural generalizations of importance sampling, which is most familiar to statistical audiences. The former generalizes importance sampling through the use of a single "bridge" density and is thus a case of bridge sampling in the sense of Meng and Wong. Thermodynamic integration, which is also known in the numerical analysis literature as Ogata's method for high-dimensional integration, corresponds to the use of infinitely many and continuously connected bridges (and thus a "path"). Our path sampling formulation offers more flexibility and thus potential efficiency to thermodynamic integration, and the search of optimal paths turns out to have close connections with the Jeffreys prior density and the Rao and Hellinger distances between two densities. We provide an informative theoretical example as well as two empirical examples (involving 17-to 70-dimensional integrations) to illustrate the potential and implementation of path sampling. We also discuss some open problems.},

  abstract = {The finite element method (FEM) is one of the great triumphs of modern day applied mathematics, numerical analysis and algorithm development. Engineering and the sciences benefit from the ability to simulate complex systems with FEM. At the same time the ability to obtain data by measurements from these complex systems, often through sensor networks, poses the question of how one systematically incorporates data into the FEM, consistently updating the finite element solution in the face of mathematical model misspecification with physical reality. This paper presents a statistical construction of FEM which goes beyond forward uncertainty propagation or solving inverse problems, and for the first time provides the means for the coherent synthesis of data and FEM.},

  abstract = {The increased availability of observation data from engineering systems in operation poses the question of how to incorporate this data into finite element models. To this end, we propose a novel statistical construction of the finite element method that provides the means of synthesising measurement data and finite element models. The Bayesian statistical framework is adopted to treat all the uncertainties present in the data, the mathematical model and its finite element discretisation. From the outset, we postulate a data-generating model which additively decomposes data into a finite element, a model misspecification and a noise component. Each of the components may be uncertain and is considered as a random variable with a respective prior probability density. The prior of the finite element component is given by a conventional stochastic forward problem. The prior probabilities of the model misspecification and measurement noise, without loss of generality, are assumed to have zero-mean and known covariance structure. Our proposed statistical model is hierarchical in the sense that each of the three random components may depend on non-observable random hyperparameters. Because of the hierarchical structure of the statistical model, Bayes rule is applied on three different levels in turn to infer the posterior densities of the three random components and hyperparameters. On level one, we determine the posterior densities of the finite element component and the true system response using the prior finite element density given by the forward problem and the data likelihood. On the next level, we infer the hyperparameter posterior densities from their respective priors and the marginal likelihood of the first inference problem. Finally, on level three we use Bayes rule to choose the most suitable finite element model in light of the observed data by computing the model posteriors.},

This noise, due to natural variability and measurement error, poses a challenge to conventional change point detection methods. We propose a novel and robust statistical method for change point detection for noisy biological time sequences. Our method is a significant improvement over traditional change point detection methods, which only examine a potential anomaly at a single time point. In contrast, our method considers all suspected anomaly points and considers the joint probability distribution of the number of change points and the elapsed time between two consecutive anomalies. We validate our method with three simulated time series, a widely accepted benchmark data set, two geological time series, a data set of ECG recordings, and a physiological data set of heart rate variability measurements of fetal sheep model of human labor, comparing it to three existing methods. Our method demonstrates significantly improved performance over the existing point-wise detection methods.},

  year = {2019},
  abstract = {At the heart of structural engineering research is the use of data obtained from physical structures such as bridges, viaducts and buildings. These data can represent how the structure responds to various stimuli over time when in operation. Many models have been proposed in literature to represent such data, such as linear statistical models. Based upon these models, the health of the structure is reasoned about, e.g. through damage indices, changes in likelihood and statistical parameter estimates. On the other hand, physics-based models are typically used when designing structures to predict how the structure will respond to operational stimuli. These models represent how the structure responds to stimuli under idealised conditions. What remains unclear in the literature is how to combine the observed data with information from the idealised physics-based model into a model that describes the responses of the operational structure. This paper introduces a new approach which fuses together observed data from a physical structure during operation and information from a mathematical model. The observed data are combined with data simulated from the physics-based model using a multi-output Gaussian process formulation. The novelty of this method is how the information from observed data and the physics-based model is balanced to obtain a representative model of the structures response to stimuli. We present our method using data obtained from a fibre-optic sensor network installed on experimental railway sleepers. The curvature of the sleeper at sensor and also non-sensor locations is modelled, guided by the mathematical representation. We discuss how this approach can be used to reason about changes in the structures behaviour over time using simulations and experimental data. The results show that the methodology can accurately detect such changes. They also indicate that the methodology can infer information about changes in the parameters within the physics-based model, including those governing components of the structure not measured directly by sensors such as the ballast foundation.},

Several classical metrics on distributions are recovered when the function space used to compute the difference in expectations is allowed to be more general (eg. a Banach space). We apply our two-sample tests to a variety of problems, including attribute matching for databases using the Hungarian marriage method, where they perform strongly. Excellent performance is also obtained when comparing distributions over graphs, for which these are the first such tests.},

To address this challenge, we significantly accelerate the computation of the Gaussian Process (GP) for time series data. In the context of a Change Point Detection (CPD) algorithm, we reduce its computational complexity from O(n5) to O(n2). Our efficient algorithm makes it possible to compute the Change Points using the hourly price data from the California Electricity Crisis.

Change-point analysis of an unlabelled sample of observations consists in, first, testing whether a change in the distribution occurs within the sample, and second, if a change occurs, estimating the change-point instant after which the distribution of the observations switches from one distribution to another different distribution. We propose a test statistic based upon the maximum kernel Fisher discriminant ratio as a measure of homogeneity between segments. We derive its limiting distribution under the null hypothesis (no change occurs), and establish the consistency under the alternative hypothesis (a change occurs). This allows to build a statistical hypothesis testing procedure for testing the presence of a change-point, with a prescribed false-alarm probability and detection probability tending to one in the large-sample setting. If a change actually occurs, the test statistic also yields an estimator of the change-point location. Promising experimental results in temporal segmentation of mental tasks from BCI data and pop song indexation are presented.},

Such methods are typically computationally intensive. Recent work in the penalised optimisation setting has focussed on developing a pruning-based approach which gives an improved computational cost that, under certain conditions, is linear in the number of data points. Such an approach naturally requires the specification of a penalty to avoid under/over-fitting. Work has been undertaken to identify the appropriate penalty choice for data generating processes with known distributional form, but in many applications the model assumed for the data is not correct and these penalty choices are not always appropriate. Consequently it is desirable to have an approach that enables us to compare segmentations for different choices of penalty. To this end we present a method to obtain optimal changepoint segmentations of data sequences for all penalty values across a continuous range. This permits an evaluation of the various segmentations to identify a suitably parsimonious penalty choice. The computational complexity of this approach can be linear in the number of data points and linear in the difference between the number of changepoints in the optimal segmentations for the smallest and largest penalty values. This can be orders of magnitude faster than alternative approaches that find optimal segmentations for a range of the number of changepoints.},

Within applications such as climate science and astrophysics, the need to make decisions on the basis of computations with large and complex data have led to a renewed focus on the management of numerical uncertainty. We describe how several seminal classic numerical methods can be interpreted naturally as probabilistic inference. We then show that the probabilistic view suggests new algorithms that can flexibly be adapted to suit application specifics, while delivering improved empirical performance. We provide concrete illustrations of the benefits of probabilistic numeric algorithms on real scientific problems from astrometry and astronomical imaging, while highlighting open problems with these new algorithms. Finally, we describe how probabilistic numerical methods provide a coherent framework for identifying the uncertainty in calculations performed with a combination of numerical algorithms (e.g. both numerical optimizers and differential equation solvers), potentially allowing the diagnosis (and control) of error sources in computations.},

This leads to new Riemannian algorithms for mean value computations and principal geodesic analysis. Marginalisation also means results can be less precise than point estimates, enabling a noticeable speed-up over the state of the art. Our approach is an argument for a wider point that uncertainty caused by numerical calculations should be tracked throughout the pipeline of machine learning algorithms.},

This prompts us to propose a computationally tractable isometric vector transport on the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal p-frames in Rn. Specifically, it requires O(np2) flops, which is considerably less expensive than existing alternatives in the frequently encountered case where n p. We then build on this result to also propose computationally tractable isometric vector transports on other manifolds, namely the Grassmann manifold, the fixed-rank manifold, and the positivesemidefinite fixed-rank manifold. In the process, we also propose a convenient way to represent tangent vectors to these manifolds as elements of Rd, where d is the dimension of the manifold. We call this an ``intrinsic'' representation, as opposed to ``extrinsic'' representations as elements of Rw, where w is the dimension of the embedding space. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed isometric vector transport in the context of a Riemannian quasi-Newton method applied to minimizing the Brockett cost function.},

The MCD estimator is reviewed, along with its main properties such as affine equivariance, breakdown value, and influence function. We discuss its computation, and list applications and extensions of the MCD in applied and methodological multivariate statistics. Two recent extensions of the MCD are described. The first one is a fast deterministic algorithm which inherits the robustness of the MCD while being almost affine equivariant. The second is tailored to high-dimensional data, possibly with more dimensions than cases, and incorporates regularization to prevent singular matrices.},

We prove that the condition numbers of the stiffness matrices grow like p 4(d-1) , where d is the number of dimensions. Our results disprove a conjecture of Olsen and Douglas in which the authors assert that "regardless of the choice of basis, the condition numbers grow like p 4d or faster".

Here, we propose 10 ``rules'' centered on 2 best practice components: clean code and testing. These 2 areas are relatively straightforward and provide substantial utility relative to the learning investment. Adopting clean code practices helps to standardize and organize software code in order to enhance readability and reduce cognitive load for both the initial developer and subsequent contributors; this allows developers to concentrate on core functionality and reduce errors. Clean coding styles make software code more amenable to testing, including unit tests that work best with modular and consistent software code. Unit tests interrogate specific and isolated coding behavior to reduce coding errors and ensure intended functionality, especially as code increases in complexity; unit tests also implicitly provide example usages of code. Other forms of testing are geared to discover erroneous behavior arising from unexpected inputs or emerging from the interaction of complex codebases. Although conforming to coding styles and designing tests can add time to the software development project in the short term, these foundational tools can help to improve the correctness, quality, usability, and maintainability of open-source scientific software code. They also advance the principal point of scientific research: producing accurate results in a reproducible way. In addition to suggesting several tips for getting started with clean code and testing practices, we recommend numerous tools for the popular open-source scientific software languages Python, R, and Julia.},

For instance, we prove that almost every C1 map on R" has the property that all of its periodic orbits are hyperbolic.},

This enables an expressive programming model for deep learning and, more importantly, it enables users to utilize the existing Julia ecosystem of scientific computing packages in deep learning models. We discuss support for advanced techniques such as mixed-mode, complex and checkpointed differentiation, and present how this leads to efficient code generation. We then showcase several examples of differentiating programs and mixing deep learning with existing Julia packages, including differentiable ray tracing, machine learning on simulated quantum hardware, training neural stochastic differential equation representations of financial models and more.},

  abstract = {Introduction AN IMPORTANT class of theoretical and practical problems in communication and control is of a statistical nature. Such problems are: (i) Prediction of random signals; (ii) separation of random signals from random noise; (iii) detection of signals of known form (pulses, sinusoids) in the presence of random noise. In his pioneering work, Wiener [1] 3 showed that problems (i) and (ii) lead to the so-called Wiener-Hopf integral equation; he also gave a method (spectral factorization) for the solution of this integral equation in the practically important special case of stationary statistics and rational spectra. Many extensions and generalizations followed Wiener's basic work. Zadeh and Ragazzini solved the finite-memory case [2]. Concurrently and independently of Bode and Shannon [3], they also gave a simplified method [2] of solution. Booton discussed the nonstationary Wiener-Hopf equation [4]. These results are now in standard texts [5-6]. A somewhat different approach along these main lines has been given recently by Darlington [7]. For extensions to sampled signals, see, e.g., Franklin [8], Lees [9]. Another approach based on the eigenfunctions of the Wiener-Hopf equation (which applies also to nonstationary problems whereas the preceding methods in general don't), has been pioneered by Davis [10] and applied by many others, e.g., Shinbrot [11], Blum [12], Pugachev [13], Solodovnikov [14]. In all these works, the objective is to obtain the specification of a linear dynamic system (Wiener filter) which accomplishes the prediction, separation, or detection of a random signal. 4-Present methods for solving the Wiener problem are subject to a number of limitations which seriously curtail their practical usefulness: (1) The optimal filter is specified by its impulse response. It is not a simple task to synthesize the filter from such data. (2) Numerical determination of the optimal impulse response is often quite involved and poorly suited to machine computation. The situation gets rapidly worse with increasing complexity of the problem. (3) Important generalizations (e.g., growing-memory filters, nonstationary prediction) require new derivations, frequently of considerable difficulty to the nonspecialist. (4) The mathematics of the derivations are not transparent. Fundamental assumptions and their consequences tend to be obscured. This paper introduces a new look at this whole assemblage of problems, sidestepping the difficulties just mentioned. The following are the highlights of the paper: (5) Optimal Estimates and Orthogonal Projections. The Wiener problem is approached from the point of view of conditional distributions and expectations. In this way, basic facts of the Wiener theory are quickly obtained; the scope of the results and the fundamental assumptions appear clearly. It is seen that all statistical calculations and results are based on first and second order averages; no other statistical data are needed. Thus difficulty (4) is eliminated. This method is well known in probability theory (see pp. 75-78 and 148-155 of Doob [15] and pp. 455-464 of Lo\`eve [16]) but has not yet been used extensively in engineering. (6) Models for Random Processes. Following, in particular, Bode and Shannon [3], arbitrary random signals are represented (up to second order average statistical properties) as the output of a linear dynamic system excited by independent or uncorrelated random signals ("white noise"). This is a standard trick in the engineering applications of the Wiener theory [2-7]. The approach taken here differs from the conventional one only in the way in which linear dynamic systems are described. We shall emphasize the concepts of state and state transition; in other words, linear systems will be specified by systems of first-order difference (or differential) equations. This point of view is A New Approach to Linear Filtering and Prediction Problems 1 The classical filtering and prediction problem is reexamined using the Bode-Shannon representation of random processes and the "state transition" method of analysis of dynamic systems. New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the coefficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.},

We provide a probabilistic error analysis for a prototypical statFEM setup based on a Gaussian process prior under the assumption that the noisy measurement data are generated by a deterministic true system response function that satisfies a second-order elliptic partial differential equation for an unknown true source term. In certain cases, properties such as the smoothness of the source term may be misspecified by the Gaussian process model. The error estimates we derive are for the expectation with respect to the measurement noise of the \$L\^2\$-norm of the difference between the true system response and the mean of the statFEM posterior. The estimates imply polynomial rates of convergence in the numbers of measurement points and finite element basis functions and depend on the Sobolev smoothness of the true source term and the Gaussian process model. A numerical example for Poisson's equation is used to illustrate these theoretical results.},

Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of specific applications. However, in any specific application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the specific context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of fitting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc fitting, and after calibration the model is used, with the fitted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the fitted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-fitting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

Recently, Con-rad et al. introduced a sampling-based class of methods that are 'well-calibrated' in a specific sense. But the computational cost of these methods is significantly above that of classic methods. On the other hand, Schober et al. pointed out a precise connection between classic Runge-Kutta ODE solvers and Gaussian filters, which gives only a rough probabilistic calibration, but at negligible cost overhead. By formulating the solution of ODEs as approximate inference in linear Gaussian SDEs, we investigate a range of probabilistic ODE solvers, that bridge the trade-off between computational cost and probabilistic calibration, and identify the inaccurate gradient measurement as the crucial source of uncertainty. We propose the novel filtering-based method Bayesian Quadrature filtering (BQF) which uses Bayesian quadrature to actively learn the impre-cision in the gradient measurement by collecting multiple gradient evaluations.},

One of the key issues is to identify long-term changes accurately in time-varying data. Bayesian Online Change Point Detection (BO-CPD) algorithms efficiently detect long-term changes without assuming the Markov property which is vulnerable to local signal noise. We propose a Document based BO-CPD (DBO-CPD) model which automatically detects long-term temporal changes of continuous variables based on a novel dynamic Bayesian analysis which combines a non-parametric regression, the Gaussian Process (GP), with generative models of texts such as news articles and posts on social networks. Since texts often include important clues of signal changes, DBO-CPD enables the accurate prediction of long-term changes accurately. We show that our algorithm outperforms existing BO-CPDs in two real-world datasets: stock prices and movie revenues.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

More generally, we consider a linear time series model and penalize the comparator sequence through the energy of the implied driving noise terms. We derive the minimax strategy for all problems of this type and show that it can be implemented efficiently. The optimal predictions are linear in the previous observations. We obtain an explicit expression for the regret in terms of the parameters defining the problem. For typical, simple definitions of smoothness, the computation of the optimal predictions involves only sparse matrices. In the case of norm-constrained data, where the smoothness is defined in terms of the squared norm of the comparator's increments, we show that the regret grows as T/{$\surd\Lambda$}T, where T is the length of the game and {$\Lambda$}T is an increasing limit on comparator smoothness.},

Although the theoretical analysis of ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator is as old, several fundamental questions are yet to be answered. Suppose regression observations pX1, Y1q, . . . , pXn, Ynq P Rd \textasciicircum{} R (not necessarily independent) are available. Some of the questions we deal with are as follows: under what conditions, does the OLS estimator converge and what is the limit? What happens if the dimension is allowed to grow with n? What happens if the observations are dependent with dependence possibly strengthening with n? How to do statistical inference under these kinds of misspecification? What happens to OLS estimator under variable selection? How to do inference under misspecification and variable selection? We answer all the questions raised above with one simple deterministic inequality which holds for any set of observations and any sample size. This implies that all our results are finite sample (non-asymptotic) in nature. At the end, one only needs to bound certain random quantities under specific settings of interest to get concrete rates and we derive these bounds for the case of independent observations. In particular the problem of inference after variable selection is studied, for the first time, when d, the number of covariates increases (almost exponentially) with sample size n. We provide comments on the ``right'' statistic to consider for inference under variable selection and efficient computation of quantiles.},

The former, standard in manifold optimization, has the downside of relying on equivalence classes but working with orthogonal matrices is generally good numerical practice. The latter, widely adopted in coding theory and probability, uses actual matrices (as opposed to equivalence classes) but working with projection matrices is numerically unstable. We present an alternative that has both advantages and suffers from neither of the disadvantages; by representing k-dimensional subspaces as symmetric orthogonal matrices of trace 2k - n, we obtain Gr(k, n) {$\sim$}= \{Q {$\in$} O(n) : QT = Q, tr(Q) = 2k - n\}. As with the other two models, we show that differential geometric objects and operations \textemdash{} tangent vector, metric, normal vector, exponential map, geodesic, parallel transport, gradient, Hessian, etc \textemdash{} have closed-form analytic expressions that are computable with standard numerical linear algebra. In the proposed model, these expressions are considerably simpler, a result of representing Gr(k, n) as a linear section of a compact matrix Lie group O(n), and can be computed with at most one qr decomposition and one exponential of a special skew-symmetric matrix that takes only O nk(n - k) time. In particular, we completely avoid eigen- and singular value decompositions in our steepest descent, conjugate gradient, quasi-Newton, and Newton methods for the Grassmannian. Another important feature of these algorithms, particularly evident in steepest descent and Newton method, is that they exhibit clear signs of numerical stability; various measures of errors consistently reduce to the order of machine precision throughout extensive numerical experiments.},

Recently, it has been shown that models with little to no inductive biases (i.e., with no assumptions about the problem embedded in the model) are likely to have trainability and generalization issues, especially for large problem sizes. As such, it is fundamental to develop schemes that encode as much information as available about the problem at hand. In this work we present a simple, yet powerful, framework where the underlying invariances in the data are used to build QML models that, by construction, respect those symmetries. These so-called group-invariant models produce outputs that remain invariant under the action of any element of the symmetry group \$\textbackslash mathfrak\{G\}\$ associated to the dataset. We present theoretical results underpinning the design of \$\textbackslash mathfrak\{G\}\$-invariant models, and exemplify their application through several paradigmatic QML classification tasks including cases when \$\textbackslash mathfrak\{G\}\$ is a continuous Lie group and also when it is a discrete symmetry group. Notably, our framework allows us to recover, in an elegant way, several well known algorithms for the literature, as well as to discover new ones. Taken together, we expect that our results will help pave the way towards a more geometric and group-theoretic approach to QML model design.},

We believe coordinated efforts between motifs offers immense opportunity to accelerate scientific discovery, from solving inverse problems in synthetic biology and climate science, to directing nuclear energy experiments and predicting emergent behavior in socioeconomic settings. We elaborate on each layer of the SI-stack, detailing the state-of-art methods, presenting examples to highlight challenges and opportunities, and advocating for specific ways to advance the motifs and the synergies from their combinations.

The impact of going from an ordinary to a stochastic differential equation setting is investigated as a tool to overcome the problem of local minima in the objective function. Using two different models, it is demonstrated that by allowing noise in the underlying model itself, the objective functions to be minimized in the parameter estimation procedures are regularized in the sense that the number of local minima is reduced and better convergence is achieved. The advantage of using stochastic differential equations is that the actual states in the model are predicted from data and this will allow the prediction to stay close to data even when the parameters in the model is incorrect. The extended Kalman filter is used as a state estimator and sensitivity equations are provided to give an accurate calculation of the gradient of the objective function. The method is illustrated using in silico data from the FitzHugh-Nagumo model for excitable media and the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system. The proposed method performs well on the models considered, and is able to regularize the objective function in both models. This leads to parameter estimation problems with fewer local minima which can be solved by efficient gradient-based methods. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a framework for Bayesian inference that can offer principled uncertainty estimates for a large range of problems. For example, if we consider regression problems with Gaussian likelihoods, a GP model enjoys a posterior in closed form. However, identifying the posterior GP scales cubically with the number of training examples and requires to store all examples in memory. In order to overcome these obstacles, sparse GPs have been proposed that approximate the true posterior GP with pseudo-training examples. Importantly, the number of pseudo-training examples is user-defined and enables control over computational and memory complexity. In the general case, sparse GPs do not enjoy closed-form solutions and one has to resort to approximate inference. In this context, a convenient choice for approximate inference is variational inference (VI), where the problem of Bayesian inference is cast as an optimization problem -- namely, to maximize a lower bound of the log marginal likelihood. This paves the way for a powerful and versatile framework, where pseudo-training examples are treated as optimization arguments of the approximate posterior that are jointly identified together with hyperparameters of the generative model (i.e. prior and likelihood). The framework can naturally handle a wide scope of supervised learning problems, ranging from regression with heteroscedastic and non-Gaussian likelihoods to classification problems with discrete labels, but also multilabel problems. The purpose of this tutorial is to provide access to the basic matter for readers without prior knowledge in both GPs and VI. A proper exposition to the subject enables also access to more recent advances (like importance-weighted VI as well as interdomain, multioutput and deep GPs) that can serve as an inspiration for new research ideas.},

  abstract = {Differential equation (DE) models are widely used in many scientific fields, including engineering, physics, and biomedical sciences. The so-called "forward problem," the problem of simulations and predictions of state variables for given parameter values in the DE models, has been extensively studied by mathematicians, physicists, engineers, and other scientists. However, the "inverse problem," the problem of parameter estimation based on the measurements of output variables, has not been well explored using modern statistical methods, although some least squares-based approaches have been proposed and studied. In this article we propose parameter estimation methods for ordinary differential equation (ODE) models based on the local smoothing approach and a pseudo-least squares (PsLS) principle under a framework of measurement error in regression models. The asymptotic properties of the proposed PsLS estimator are established. We also compare the PsLS method to the corresponding simulation-extrapolation (SIMEX) method and evaluate their finite-sample performances via simulation studies. We illustrate the proposed approach using an application example from an HIV dynamic study.},

It is thus a potentially useful approach in a number of applications such as forward uncertainty quantification, inverse problems, and data assimilation. We extend the convergence analysis of probabilistic in-tegrators for deterministic ordinary differential equations , as proposed by Conrad et al. (Stat. Comput., 2017), to establish mean-square convergence in the uniform norm on discrete-or continuous-time solutions under relaxed regularity assumptions on the driving vector fields and their induced flows. Specifically, we show that randomised high-order integrators for globally Lipschitz flows and randomised Euler integrators for dissipative vector fields with polynomially-bounded local Lipschitz constants all have the same mean-square convergence rate as their deterministic counterparts, provided that the variance of the integration noise is not of higher order than the corresponding deterministic integrator. These and similar results are proven for probabilistic integrators where the random perturbations may be state-dependent, non-Gaussian, or non-centred random variables.},

Recently, this has been generalized to neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces. For partial differential equations (PDEs), neural operators directly learn the mapping from any functional parametric dependence to the solution. Thus, they learn an entire family of PDEs, in contrast to classical methods which solve one instance of the equation. In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efficient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The Fourier neural operator is the first ML-based method to successfully model turbulent flows with zero-shot super-resolution. It is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers. Additionally, it achieves superior accuracy compared to previous learning-based solvers under fixed resolution.},

  abstract = {Detecting the emergence of an abrupt change-point is a classic problem in statistics and machine learning. Kernel-based nonparametric statistics have been proposed for this task which make fewer assumptions on the distributions than traditional parametric approach. However, none of the existing kernel statistics has provided a computationally efficient way to characterize the extremal behavior of the statistic. Such characterization is crucial for setting the detection threshold, to control the significance level in the offline case as well as the average run length in the online case. In this paper we propose two related computationally efficient M -statistics for kernel-based change-point detection when the amount of background data is large. A novel theoretical result of the paper is the characterization of the tail probability of these statistics using a new technique based on change-ofmeasure. Such characterization provides us accurate detection thresholds for both offline and online cases in computationally efficient manner, without the need to resort to the more expensive simulations such as bootstrapping. We show that our methods perform well in both synthetic and real world data.},

A new algorithm is proposed which includes the use of the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) Gauss-Newton approximation but also encompasses the SQP Newton approximation along with tests of when to use this approximation. This composite approach relaxes the restrictions on the SQP Gauss-Newton approximation that the hypothesized model should be correct and the sample data set large enough.

  abstract = {Modern advances in computing power have greatly widened scientists' scope in gathering and investigating information from many variables, information which might have been ignored in the past. Yet to effectively scan a large pool of variables is not an easy task, although our ability to interact with data has been much enhanced by recent innovations in dynamic graphics. In this article, we propose a novel data-analytic tool, sliced inverse regression (SIR), for reducing the dimension of the input variable x without going through any parametric or nonparametric model-fitting process. This method explores the simplicity of the inverse view of regression; that is, instead of regressing the univariate output variable y against the multivariate x, we regress x against y. Forward regression and inverse regression are connected by a theorem that motivates this method. The theoretical properties of SIR are investigated under a model of the form, y = f({$\beta$}1x, ..., {$\beta$}Kx, {$\epsilon$}), where the {$\beta$}k's are the unknown row vectors. This model looks like a nonlinear regression, except for the crucial difference that the functional form of f is completely unknown. For effectively reducing the dimension, we need only to estimate the space [effective dimension reduction (e.d.r.) space] generated by the {$\beta$}k's. This makes our goal different from the usual one in regression analysis, the estimation of all the regression coefficients. In fact, the {$\beta$}k's themselves are not identifiable without a specific structural form on f. Our main theorem shows that under a suitable condition, if the distribution of x has been standardized to have the zero mean and the identity covariance, the inverse regression curve, E(x {$\mid$} y), will fall into the e.d.r. space. Hence a principal component analysis on the covariance matrix for the estimated inverse regression curve can be conducted to locate its main orientation, yielding our estimates for e.d.r. directions. Furthermore, we use a simple step function to estimate the inverse regression curve. No complicated smoothing is needed. SIR can be easily implemented on personal computers. By simulation, we demonstrate how SIR can effectively reduce the dimension of the input variable from, say, 10 to K = 2 for a data set with 400 observations. The spin-plot of y against the two projected variables obtained by SIR is found to mimic the spin-plot of y against the true directions very well. A chi-squared statistic is proposed to address the issue of whether or not a direction found by SIR is spurious.},

  abstract = {This book gives a comprehensive introduction to numerical methods and analysis of stochastic processes, random fields and stochastic differential equations, and offers graduate students and researchers powerful tools for understanding uncertainty quantification for risk analysis. Coverage includes traditional stochastic ODEs with white noise forcing, strong and weak approximation, and the multi-level Monte Carlo method. Later chapters apply the theory of random fields to the numerical solution of elliptic PDEs with correlated random data, discuss the Monte Carlo method, and introduce stochastic Galerkin finite-element methods. Finally, stochastic parabolic PDEs are developed. Assuming little previous exposure to probability and statistics, theory is developed in tandem with state-of the art computational methods through worked examples, exercises, theorems and proofs. The set of MATLAB codes included (and downloadable) allows readers to perform computations themselves and solve the test problems discussed. Practical examples are drawn from finance, mathematical biology, neuroscience, fluid flow modeling and materials science.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating a sparse linear regression vector {$\beta$} {${_\ast}$} under a Gaussian noise model, for the purpose of both prediction and model selection. We assume that prior knowledge is available on the sparsity pattern, namely the set of variables is partitioned into prescribed groups, only few of which are relevant in the estimation process. This group sparsity assumption suggests us to consider the Group Lasso method as a means to estimate {$\beta$} {${_\ast}$}.We establish oracle inequalities for the prediction and {$\mathscr{l}$}2 estimation errors of this estimator. These bounds hold under a restricted eigenvalue condition on the design matrix. Under a stronger condition, we derive bounds for the estimation error for mixed (2,p)-norms with 1 {$\leq$} p{$\leq\infty$}. When p={$\infty$}, this result implies that a thresholded version of the Group Lasso estimator selects the sparsity pattern of {$\beta$} {${_\ast}$} with high probability. Next, we prove that the rate of convergence of our upper bounds is optimal in a minimax sense, up to a logarithmic factor, for all estimators over a class of group sparse vectors. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds for the prediction and {$\mathscr{l}$}2 estimation errors of the usual Lasso estimator. Using this result, we demonstrate that the Group Lasso can achieve an improvement in the prediction and estimation errors as compared to the Lasso.},

  abstract = {We develop and evaluate an approach to causal modeling based on time series data, collectively referred to as\textbackslash grouped graphical Granger modeling methods." Graphical Granger modeling uses graphical modeling techniques on time series data and invokes the notion of \textbackslash Granger causality" to make assertions on causality among a potentially large number of time series variables through inference on time-lagged effects. The present paper proposes a novel enhancement to the graphical Granger methodology by developing and applying families of regression methods that are sensitive to group information among variables, to leverage the group structure present in the lagged temporal variables according to the time series they belong to. Additionally, we propose a new family of algorithms we call group boosting, as an improved component of grouped graphical Granger modeling over the existing regression methods with grouped variable selection in the literature (e.g group Lasso). The introduction of group boosting methods is primarily motivated by the need to deal with non-linearity in the data. We perform empirical evaluation to confirm the advantage of the grouped graphical Granger methods over the standard (non-grouped) methods, as well as that specific to the methods based on group boosting. This advantage is also demonstrated for the real world application of gene regulatory network discovery from time-course microarray data. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

  abstract = {While it is widely known that neural networks are universal approximators of continuous functions, a less known and perhaps more powerful result is that a neural network with a single hidden layer can approximate accurately any nonlinear continuous operator. This universal approximation theorem is suggestive of the potential application of neural networks in learning nonlinear operators from data. However, the theorem guarantees only a small approximation error for a sufficient large network, and does not consider the important optimization and generalization errors. To realize this theorem in practice, we propose deep operator networks (DeepONets) to learn operators accurately and efficiently from a relatively small dataset. A DeepONet consists of two sub-networks, one for encoding the input function at a fixed number of sensors \$x\_i, i=1,\textbackslash dots,m\$ (branch net), and another for encoding the locations for the output functions (trunk net). We perform systematic simulations for identifying two types of operators, i.e., dynamic systems and partial differential equations, and demonstrate that DeepONet significantly reduces the generalization error compared to the fully-connected networks. We also derive theoretically the dependence of the approximation error in terms of the number of sensors (where the input function is defined) as well as the input function type, and we verify the theorem with computational results. More importantly, we observe high-order error convergence in our computational tests, namely polynomial rates (from half order to fourth order) and even exponential convergence with respect to the training dataset size.},

  abstract = {ii We collect here the revised edition of the 19 th Internet Seminar on "Infinite dimensional analysis". In the lectures, we consider separable infinite dimensional Banach spaces endowed with Gaussian measures and we describe their main properties; in particular we are interested in integration by parts formulae that allow the definition of gradient and divergence operators. Once these tools are introduced, we study Sobolev spaces. In the context of Gaussian analysis the role of the Laplacian ({$\increment$} = div) is played by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator. We study the realisation of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup in spaces of continuous functions and in L p spaces. In particular, for p = 2 the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator is self-adjoint and we show that there exists an orthogonal basis consisting of explicit eigenfunctions (the Hermite polynomials) that give raise to the "Wiener Chaos Decomposition". In the present revision we have taken into account the feedback coming from all the participants to the discussion board and we are grateful for all the contributions, which have corrected many mistakes and improved the presentation. We warmly thank in particular , Prof. J\"urgen Voigt and the whole Dresden group for their careful reading and their constructive criticism. We are planning to prepare another revision after the final workshop in Casalmaggiore, where we shall take into account possible further commnets.},

In this paper, we propose a new solution to this problem called Functional Variational Inference (FVI). In FVI, we minimize a divergence in function space between the variational distribution and the posterior process. This is done by using as functional variational family a new class of flexible distributions called Stochastic Process Generators (SPGs), which are cleverly designed so that the functional ELBO can be estimated efficiently using analytic solutions and mini-batch sampling. FVI can be applied to stochastic process priors when random function samples from those priors are available. Our experiments show that FVI consistently outperforms weight-space and function space VI methods on several tasks, which validates the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract = {Recently there has been increasing interest in probabilistic solvers for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that return full probability measures, instead of point estimates, over the solution and can incorporate uncertainty over the ODE at hand, e.g. if the vector field or the initial value is only approximately known or evaluable. The ODE filter proposed in [9, 16] models the solution of the ODE by a Gauss-Markov process which serves as a prior in the sense of Bayesian statistics. While previous work employed a Wiener process prior on the (possibly multiple times) differentiated solution of the ODE and established equivalence of the corresponding solver with classical numerical methods, this paper raises the question whether other priors also yield practically useful solvers. To this end, we discuss a range of possible priors which enable fast filtering and propose a new prior-the Integrated Ornstein Uhlenbeck Process (IOUP)-that complements the existing Integrated Wiener process (IWP) filter by encoding the property that a derivative in time of the solution is bounded in the sense that it tends to drift back to zero. We provide experiments comparing IWP and IOUP filters which support the belief that IWP approximates better divergent ODE's solutions whereas IOUP is a better prior for trajectories with bounded derivatives.},

  abstract = {Many computer vision algorithms employ subspace models to represent data. Many of these approaches benefit from the ability to create an average or prototype for a set of subspaces. The most popular method in these situations is the Karcher mean, also known as the Riemannian center of mass. The prevalence of the Karcher mean may lead some to assume that it provides the best average in all scenarios. However, other subspace averages that appear less frequently in the literature may be more appropriate for certain tasks. The extrinsic manifold mean, the L2-median, and the flag mean are alternative averages that can be substituted directly for the Karcher mean in many applications. This paper evaluates the characteristics and performance of these four averages on synthetic and real-world data. While the Karcher mean generalizes the Euclidean mean to the Grassman manifold, we show that the extrinsic manifold mean, the L2-median, and the flag mean behave more like medians and are therefore more robust to the presence of outliers among the subspaces being averaged. We also show that while the Karcher mean and L2-median are computed using iterative algorithms, the extrinsic manifold mean and flag mean can be found analytically and are thus orders of magnitude faster in practice. Finally, we show that the flag mean is a generalization of the extrinsic manifold mean that permits subspaces with different numbers of dimensions to be averaged. The result is a ''cookbook'' that maps algorithm constraints and data properties to the most appropriate subspace mean for a given application.},

INLA is a deterministic paradigm for Bayesian inference in latent Gaussian models (LGMs) introduced in Rue et al. (2009). INLA relies on a combination of analytical approximations and efficient numerical integration schemes to achieve highly accurate deterministic approximations to posterior quantities of interest. The main benefit of using INLA instead of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for LGMs is computational; INLA is fast even for large, complex models. Moreover, being a deterministic algorithm, INLA does not suffer from slow convergence and poor mixing. INLA is implemented in the R package R-INLA, which represents a user-friendly and versatile tool for doing Bayesian inference. R-INLA returns posterior marginals for all model parameters and the corresponding posterior summary information. Model choice criteria as well as predictive diagnostics are directly available. Here, we outline the theory behind INLA, present the R-INLA package and describe new developments of combining INLA with MCMC for models that are not possible to fit with R-INLA.},

  abstract = {Statisticians are increasingly posed with thought-provoking and even paradoxical questions, challenging our qualifications for entering the statistical paradises created by Big Data. By developing measures for data quality, this article suggests a framework to address such a question: ``Which one should I trust more: a 1\% survey with 60\% response rate or a self-reported administrative dataset covering 80\% of the population?'' A 5-element Euler-formula-like identity shows that for any dataset of size n, probabilistic or not, the difference between the sample average Xn and the population average XN is the product of three terms: (1) a data quality measure, {$\rho$}R,X, the correlation between{$\surd$}Xj and the response/recording indicator Rj; (2) a data quantity measure, {$\surd$}(N - n)/n, where N is the population size; and (3) a problem difficulty measure, {$\sigma$}X, the standard deviation of X. This decomposition provides multiple insights: (I) Probabilistic sampling ensures high data quality by controlling {$\rho$}R,X at the level of N-1/2; (II) When we lose this control, the impact of N is no longer canceled by {$\rho$}R,X, leading to a Law of Large Populations{$\surd$} (LLP), that is, our estimation error, relative to the benchmarking rate 1/{$\surd$}n, increases with {$\surd$}N; and (III) the ``bigness'' of such Big Data (for population inferences) should be measured by the relative size f = n/N, not the absolute size n; (IV) When combining data sources for population inferences, those relatively tiny but higher quality ones should be given far more weights than suggested by their sizes. Estimates obtained from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) of the 2016 US presidential election suggest a {$\rho$}R,X {$\approx-$}0.005 for self-reporting to vote for Donald Trump. Because of LLP, this seemingly minuscule data defect correlation implies that the simple sample proportion of the self-reported voting preference for Trump from 1\% of the US eligible voters, that is, n {$\approx$} 2,300,000, has the same mean squared error as the corresponding sample proportion from a genuine simple random sample of size n {$\approx$} 400, a 99.98\% reduction of sample size (and hence our confidence). The CCES data demonstrate LLP vividly: on average, the larger the state's voter populations, the further away the actual Trump vote shares from the usual 95\% confidence intervals based on the sample proportions. This should remind us that, without taking data quality into account, population inferences with Big Data are subject to a Big Data Paradox: the more the data, the surer we fool ourselves.},

  abstract = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide an algorithmic framework for constructing gen-erative models with several appealing properties: they do not require a likelihood function to be specified, only a generating procedure; they provide samples that are sharp and compelling; and they allow us to harness our knowledge of building highly accurate neural network classi-fiers. Here, we develop our understanding of GANs with the aim of forming a rich view of this growing area of machine learning-to build connections to the diverse set of statistical thinking on this topic, of which much can be gained by a mutual exchange of ideas. We frame GANs within the wider landscape of algorithms for learning in implicit generative models-models that only specify a stochastic procedure with which to generate data-and relate these ideas to modelling problems in related fields, such as econo-metrics and approximate Bayesian computation. We develop likelihood-free inference methods and highlight hypothesis testing as a principle for learning in implicit generative models, using which we are able to derive the objective function used by GANs, and many other related objectives. The testing viewpoint directs our focus to the general problem of density-ratio and density-difference estimation. There are four approaches for density comparison, one of which is a solution using classifiers to distinguish real from generated data. Other approaches such as divergence minimisation and moment matching have also been explored, and we synthesise these views to form an understanding in terms of the relationships between them and the wider literature, highlighting avenues for future exploration and cross-pollination. * Equal contribution 1 DeepMind, London, UK. Correspondence to: Shakir Mohamed {$<$}shakir@google.com{$>$}, Balaji Lakshmi-narayanan {$<$}balajiln@google.com{$>$}. 1. Implicit Generative Models It is useful to make a distinction between two types of prob-abilistic models: prescribed and implicit models (Diggle and Gratton, 1984). Prescribed probabilistic models are those that provide an explicit parametric specification of the distribution of an observed random variable x, specifying a log-likelihood function log q \$\th eta\$ (x) with parameters \$\th eta\$. Most models in machine learning and statistics are of this form, whether they be state-of-the-art classifiers for object recognition , complex sequence models for machine translation, or fine-grained spatio-temporal models tracking the spread of disease. Alternatively, we can specify implicit probabilis-tic models that define a stochastic procedure that directly generates data. Such models are the natural approach for problems in climate and weather, population genetics, and ecology, since the mechanistic understanding of such systems can be used to directly create a data simulator, and hence the model. It is exactly because implicit models are more natural for many problems that they are of interest and importance. Implicit generative models use a latent variable z and transform it using a deterministic function G \$\th eta\$ that maps from R m \textrightarrow{} R d using parameters \$\th eta\$. Such models are amongst the most fundamental of models, e.g., many of the basic methods for generating non-uniform random variates are based on simple implicit models and one-line transformations (Devroye, 2006). In general, implicit generative models specify a valid density on the output space that forms an effective likelihood function: x = G \$\th eta\$ (z); z {$\sim$} q(z) (1) q \$\th eta\$ (x) = {$\partial$} {$\partial$}x 1. .. {$\partial$} {$\partial$}x d G \$\th eta\$ (z){$\leq$}x q(z)dz, (2) where q(z) is a latent variable that provides the external source of randomness and equation (2) is the definition of the transformed density as the derivative of the cumulative distribution function. When the function G is well-defined, such as when the function is invertible, or has dimensions m = d with easily characterised roots, we recover the familiar rule for transformations of probability distributions. We are interested in developing more general and flexible implicit generative models where the function G is a non-linear function with d {$>$} m, specified by deep networks.},

  title = {More {{Measure Theory}}},
  abstract = {In this set of notes we sketch some results in measure theory that we don't have time to cover in full. Most of the results can be found in Rudin's Real \& Complex Analysis. Some of the results here require a certain technical assumption on measures. Definition: {$\sigma$}-Finite Measure Space A measure space (X, \textmu ) is said to be {$\sigma$}-finite if X can be expressed as a countable union of measurable sets of finite measure. For example, the real line is {$\sigma$}-finite with respect to Lebesgue measure, since R = n{$\in$}N [-n, n] and each set [-n, n] has finite measure. Similarly, the natural numbers N are {$\sigma$}-finite with respect to counting measure. Not every measure space is {$\sigma$}-finite. For example, if we put counting measure on R, then the resulting measure space is not {$\sigma$}-finite, since R cannot be expressed as a countable union of finite sets. However, most measure spaces that are important in mathematics are {$\sigma$}-finite, and it is considered a very reasonable restriction to place on a measure space. Throughout these notes we will assume that all measure spaces under consideration are {$\sigma$}-finite. Product Measures We would like to be able to use the Lebesgue integral to integrate functions on R 2 and R 3. This involves defining measures on R 2 and R 3 that correspond to areas and volume, respectively. The following theorem treats this construction from a general point of view.},

This is the fundamental problem of Bayesian statistics and machine learning, which frames all inference as expectations with respect to the posterior distribution. The key challenge is to approximate these intractable expectations. In this tutorial, we review sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), a random-sampling-based class of methods for approximate inference. First, we explain the basics of SMC, discuss practical issues, and review theoretical results. We then examine two of the main user design choices: the proposal distributions and the so called intermediate target distributions. We review recent results on how variational inference and amortization can be used to learn efficient proposals and target distributions. Next, we discuss the SMC estimate of the normalizing constant, how this can be used for pseudo-marginal inference and inference evaluation. Throughout the tutorial we illustrate the use of SMC on various models commonly used in machine learning, such as stochastic recurrent neural networks, probabilistic graphical models, and probabilistic programs.},

This gives rise to complicated posterior distributions with continuous subspaces of equal density and thus hinders efficiency of inference as well as interpretation of obtained parameters. In particular, posterior averages over factor loadings become meaningless and only model predictions are unambiguous. Here, we propose a parameterization based on Householder transformations, which remove the rotational symmetry of the posterior. Furthermore, by relying on results from random matrix theory, we establish the parameter distribution which leaves the model unchanged compared to the original rotationally symmetric formulation. In particular, we avoid the need to compute the Jacobian determinant of the parameter transformation. This allows us to efficiently implement probabilistic PCA in a rotation invariant fashion in any state of the art toolbox. Here, we implemented our model in the probabilistic programming language Stan and illustrate it on several examples.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we describe a novel, computationally efficient algorithm that facilitates the autonomous acquisition of readings from sensor networks (deciding when and which sensor to acquire readings from at any time), and which can, with minimal domain knowledge, perform a range of information processing tasks including modelling the accuracy of the sensor readings, predicting the value of missing sensor readings, and predicting how the monitored environmental variables will evolve into the future. Our motivating scenario is the need to provide situational awareness support to first responders at the scene of a large scale incident, and to this end, we describe a novel iterative formulation of a multi-output Gaussian process that can build and exploit a probabilistic model of the environmental variables being measured (including the correlations and delays that exist between them). We validate our approach using data collected from a network of weather sensors located on the south coast of England.},

  author = {Owhadi, Houman},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {Numerical homogenization, i.e. the finite-dimensional approximation of solution spaces of PDEs with arbitrary rough coefficients, requires the identification of accurate basis elements. These basis elements are oftentimes found after a laborious process of scientific investigation and plain guesswork. Can this identification problem be facilitated? Is there a general recipe/decision framework for guiding the design of basis elements? We suggest that the answer to the above questions could be positive based on the reformulation of numerical homogenization as a Bayesian Inference problem in which a given PDE with rough coefficients (or multi-scale operator) is excited with noise (random right hand side/source term) and one tries to estimate the value of the solution at a given point based on a finite number of observations. We apply this reformulation to the identification of bases for the numerical homogenization of arbitrary integro-differential equations and show that these bases have optimal recovery properties. In particular we show how Rough Polyharmonic Splines can be rediscovered as the optimal solution of a Gaussian filtering problem.},

  author = {Owhadi, Houman and Scovel, Clint and Sullivan, Tim},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {With the advent of high-performance computing, Bayesian methods are increasingly popular tools for the quantification of uncertainty throughout science and industry. Since these methods impact the making of sometimes critical decisions in increasingly complicated contexts, the sensitivity of their posterior conclusions with respect to the underlying models and prior beliefs is a pressing question for which there currently exist positive and negative results. We report new results suggesting that, although Bayesian methods are robust when the number of possible outcomes is finite or when only a finite number of marginals of the data-generating distribution are unknown, they could be generically brittle when applied to continuous systems (and their discretizations) with finite information on the data-generating distribution. If closeness is defined in terms of the total variation metric or the matching of a finite system of generalized moments, then (1) two practitioners who use arbitrarily close models and observe the same (possibly arbitrarily large amount of) data may reach opposite conclusions; and (2) any given prior and model can be slightly perturbed to achieve any desired posterior conclusions. The mechanism causing brittlenss/robustness suggests that learning and robustness are antagonistic requirements and raises the question of a missing stability condition for using Bayesian Inference in a continuous world under finite information. The application of Bayes' theorem in the form of Bayesian inference has fueled an ongoing debate with practical consequences in science, industry, medicine and law [21]. One commonly-cited justification for the application of Bayesian reasoning is Cox's theorem [15], which has been interpreted as stating that any 'natural' extension of Aristotelian logic to uncertain contexts must be Bayesian [34]. It has now been shown that Cox's theorem as originally formulated is incomplete [28] and there is debate about the 'naturality' of the additional assumptions required for its validity [1, 20, 29, 31], e.g. the assumption that knowledge can be always represented in the form of a {$\sigma$}-additive probability measure that assigns to each measurable event a single real-valued probability.},

  abstract = {For a Gaussian measure on a separable Hilbert space with covariance operator C, we show that the family of conditional measures associated with conditioning on a closed subspace S {$\perp$} are Gaussian with covariance operator the short S(C) of the operator C to S. We provide two proofs. The first uses the theory of Gaussian Hilbert spaces and a characterization of the shorted operator by Andersen and Trapp. The second uses recent developments by Corach, Maestripieri and Stojanoff on the relationship between the shorted operator and C-symmetric oblique projections onto S {$\perp$}. To obtain the assertion when such projections do not exist, we develop an approximation result for the shorted operator by showing, for any positive operator A, how to construct a sequence of approximating operators A n which possess A n-symmetric oblique projections onto S {$\perp$} such that the sequence of shorted operators S(A n) converges to S(A) in the weak operator topology. This result combined with the martingale convergence of random variables associated with the corresponding approximations C n establishes the main assertion in general. Moreover, it in turn strengthens the approximation theorem for shorted operator when the operator is trace class; then the sequence of shorted operators S(A n) converges to S(A) in trace norm.},

  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Learning can be seen as approximating an unknown function by interpolating the training data. Kriging offers a solution to this problem based on the prior specification of a kernel. We explore a numerical approximation approach to kernel selection/construction based on the simple premise that a kernel must be good if the number of interpolation points can be halved without significant loss in accuracy (measured using the intrinsic RKHS norm {$\cdot$} {$\cdot$} associated with the kernel). We first test and motivate this idea on a simple problem of recovering the Green's function of an elliptic PDE (with inhomogeneous coefficients) from the sparse observation of one of its solutions. Next we consider the problem of learning non-parametric families of deep kernels of the form K 1 (F n (x), F n (x)) with F n+1 = (I d + G n+1) \textbullet{} F n and G n+1 {$\in$} spanK 1 (F n (x i), {$\cdot$}). With the proposed approach constructing the kernel becomes equivalent to integrating a stochastic data driven dynamical system, which allows for the training of very deep (bottomless) networks and the exploration of their properties. These networks learn by constructing flow maps in the kernel and input spaces via incremental data-dependent deformations/perturbations (appearing as the cooperative counterpart of adversarial examples) and, at profound depths, they (1) can achieve accurate classification from only one data point per class (2) appear to learn archetypes of each class (3) expand distances between points that are in different classes and contract distances between points in the same class. For kernels parameterized by the weights of Convolutional Neural Networks, minimizing approximation errors incurred by halving random subsets of interpolation points, appears to outperform training (the same CNN architecture) with relative entropy and dropout.},

  abstract = {Wasserstein distances are metrics on probability distributions inspired by the problem of optimal mass transportation. Roughly speaking, they measure the minimal effort required to reconfigure the probability mass of one distribution in order to recover the other distribution. They are ubiquitous in mathematics, with a long history that has seen them catal-yse core developments in analysis, optimization, and probability. Beyond their intrinsic mathematical richness, they possess attractive features that make them a versatile tool for the statistician: they can be used to derive weak convergence and convergence of moments, and can be easily bounded; they are well-adapted to quantify a natural notion of perturbation of a probability distribution; and they seamlessly incorporate the geometry of the domain of the distributions in question, thus being useful for contrasting complex objects. Consequently, they frequently appear in the development of statistical theory and inferential methodology, and have recently become an object of inference in themselves. In this review, we provide a snapshot of the main concepts involved in Wasserstein distances and optimal transportation, and a succinct overview of some of their many statistical aspects.},

  abstract = {Optimal transport (OT) theory can be informally described using the words of the French mathematician Gaspard Monge (1746-1818): A worker with a shovel in hand has to move a large pile of sand lying on a construction site. The goal of the worker is to erect with all that sand a target pile with a prescribed shape (for example, that of a giant sand castle). Naturally, the worker wishes to minimize her total effort, quantified for instance as the total distance or time spent carrying shovelfuls of sand. Mathematicians interested in OT cast that problem as that of comparing two probability distributions, two different piles of sand of the same volume. They consider all of the many possible ways to morph, transport or reshape the first pile into the second, and associate a "global" cost to every such transport, using the "local" consideration of how much it costs to move a grain of sand from one place to another. Recent years have witnessed the spread of OT in several fields, thanks to the emergence of approximate solvers that can scale to sizes and dimensions that are relevant to data sciences. Thanks to this newfound scalability, OT is being increasingly used to unlock various problems in imaging sciences (such as color or texture processing), computer vision and graphics (for shape manipulation) or machine learning (for regression, classification and density fitting). This short book reviews OT with a bias toward numerical methods and their applications in data sciences, and sheds lights on the theoretical properties of OT that make it particularly useful for some of these applications.},

Distances for comparing positive-definite covariance matrices are either extended or shown to be inapplicable to functional data. In particular, an infinite-dimensional analogue of the Procrustes size-and-shape distance is developed. Convergence of finite-dimensional approximations to the infinite-dimensional distance metrics is also shown. For inference, a Fr\'echet estimator of both the covariance operator itself and the average covariance operator is introduced. A permutation procedure to test the equality of the covariance operators between two groups is also considered. Additionally, the use of such distances for extrapolation to make predictions is explored. As an example of the proposed methodology, the use of covariance operators has been suggested in a philological study of cross-linguistic dependence as a way to incorporate quantitative pho-netic information. It is shown that distances between languages derived from phonetic covariance functions can provide insight into the relationships between the Romance languages.},

In many cases, data are spatially distributed but it is not trivial to take into account spatial dependence in the analysis because of the non linear geometry of the manifold. This work proposes a solution to the problem of spatial prediction for manifold valued data, with a particular focus on the case of positive definite symmetric matrices. Under the hypothesis that the dispersion of the observations on the manifold is not too large, data can be projected on a suitably chosen tangent space, where an additive model can be used to describe the relationship between response variable and covariates. Thus, we generalize classical kriging prediction, dealing with the spatial dependence in this tangent space, where well established Euclidean methods can be used.

In this paper we study a coherent Bayesian kernel model based on an integral operator defined as the convolution of a kernel with a signed measure. Priors on the random signed measures correspond to prior distributions on the functions mapped by the integral operator. We study several classes of signed measures and their image mapped by the integral operator. In particular, we identify a general class of measures whose image is dense in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) induced by the kernel. A consequence of this result is a function theoretic foundation for using non-parametric prior specifications in Bayesian modeling, such as Gaussian process and Dirichlet process prior distributions. We discuss the construction of priors on spaces of signed measures using Gaussian and L\'evy processes, with the Dirichlet processes being a special case the latter. Computational issues involved with sampling from the posterior distribution are outlined for a univariate regression and a high dimensional classification problem.},

Derivatives of the resulting empirical expressions are used to avoid solving differential equations when estimating parameters. Benefits and shortcomings of PDA were examined using a simple continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) model. Although PDA required considerably less computational effort than traditional nonlinear regression, parameter estimates from PDA were less precise. Sparse and noisy data resulted in poor spline fits and misleading derivative information, leading to poor parameter estimates. These problems are addressed by a new iterative algorithm (iPDA) in which the spline fits are improved using model-based penalties. Parameter estimates from iPDA were unbiased and more precise than those from standard PDA. Issues that need to be resolved before iPDA can be used for more complex models are discussed.},

In this paper, I show that in the limit of continuous time, the momentum parameter is analogous to the mass of Newtonian particles that move through a viscous medium in a conservative force field. The behavior of the system near a local minimum is equivalent to a set of coupled and damped harmonic oscillators. The momentum term improves the speed of convergence by bringing some eigen components of the system closer to critical damping. Similar results can be obtained for the discrete time case used in computer simulations. In particular, I derive the bounds for convergence on learning-rate and momentum parameters, and demonstrate that the momentum term can increase the range of learning rate over which the system converges. The optimal condition for convergence is also analyzed.},

In this manuscript we investigate an implementation of Discrete local Sensitivity Analysis via Automatic Differentiation (DSAAD).

Our benchmarks show that on sufficiently small ({$<$}100 parameters) stiff and non-stiff systems of ODEs, forward-mode DSAAD is more efficient than both reverse-mode DSAAD and continuous forward/adjoint sensitivity analysis. The scalability of continuous adjoint methods is shown to result in better efficiency for larger ODE systems such as PDE discretizations. In addition to testing efficiency, results on test equations demonstrate the applicability of DSAAD to differential-algebraic equations, delay differential equations, and hybrid differential equation systems where the event timing and effects are dependent on model parameters. Together, these results show that language-level automatic differentiation is an efficient method for calculating local sensitivities of a wide range of differential equation models.},

Scientific models, such as Newtonian physics or biological gene regulatory networks, are human-driven simplifications of complex phenomena that serve as surrogates for the countless experiments that validated the models. Recently, machine learning has been able to overcome the inaccuracies of approximate modeling by directly learning the entire set of nonlinear interactions from data. However, without any predetermined structure from the scientific basis behind the problem, machine learning approaches are flexible but data-expensive, requiring large databases of homogeneous labeled training data. A central challenge is reconciling data that is at odds with simplified models without requiring "big data". In this work we develop a new methodology, universal differential equations (UDEs), which augments scientific models with machine-learnable structures for scientifically-based learning. We show how UDEs can be utilized to discover previously unknown governing equations, accurately extrapolate beyond the original data, and accelerate model simulation, all in a time and data-efficient manner. This advance is coupled with open-source software that allows for training UDEs which incorporate physical constraints, delayed interactions, implicitly-defined events, and intrinsic stochasticity in the model. Our examples show how a diverse set of computationally-difficult modeling issues across scientific disciplines, from automatically discovering biological mechanisms to accelerating the training of physics-informed neural networks and large-eddy simulations,},

Such equations represent changes in system outputs by linking the behaviour of derivatives of a process to the behaviour of the process itself. Current methods for estimating parameters in differential equations from noisy data are computationally intensive and often poorly suited to the realization of statistical objectives such as inference and interval estimation. The paper describes a new method that uses noisy measurements on a subset of variables to estimate the parameters defining a system of non-linear differential equations. The approach is based on a modification of data smoothing methods along with a generalization of profiled estimation. We derive estimates and confidence intervals, and show that these have low bias and good coverage properties respectively for data that are simulated from models in chemical engineering and neurobiology. The performance of the method is demonstrated by using real world data from chemistry and from the progress of the autoimmune disease lupus.},

  abstract = {Notes by Ibrahim Al Balushi \textbackslash S1 Necessity and sufficiency for invertibility In this section we derive a sufficient and necessary condition for existence of an inverse of a bounded linear map on Banach spaces. The following result, known as Banach's bounded inverse theorem, is an immediate consequence of the open mapping theorem: Let X, Y be Banach spaces and let A : X \textrightarrow{} Y be a bounded linear map. Suppose that A is invertible, then A -1 : Y \textrightarrow{} X is also bounded. Suppose that A is as in the context of the previous result. Then x = A -1 Ax {$\leq$} cAx {$\forall$}x {$\in$} X. (1.1) Definition 1.1. We say that A is bounded below if x {$\leq$} cAx for all x {$\in$} X for some c {$>$} 0. Remark. Note that if A is as such, then Ker(A) = 0, i.e., A is injective. It turns out that (1.1) is not sufficient to guarantee invertibility of A. Lemma 1.2. Let X, Y be Banach spaces and let A : X \textrightarrow{} Y be bounded and linear. A is bounded below if and only if A is injective and the range of A is closed. Proof. Suppose that A is bounded below and that x n {$\in$} X with Ax n \textrightarrow{} y {$\in$} Y. Then x n - x m {$\leq$} cAx n - Ax m \textrightarrow{} 0 as n, m \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$}; the sequence (x n) n{$\geq$}1 is Cauchy. By completeness x n \textrightarrow{} x {$\in$} X and so Ax n \textrightarrow{} Ax which makes y = Ax. Therefore y belongs to the range of A. Conversely, suppose that A : X \textrightarrow{} Ran(A) is invertible. Since Ran(A) is a Banach space, we can use the bounded inverse theorem x = A -1 Ax {$\leq$} cAx Ran(A) = cAx Y. Remark. Injectivity here can be substituted by injectivity of\texttildelow Aof\texttildelow{} of\texttildelow A : X/Ker(A) \textrightarrow{} Y to derive a condition similar to (1.1) that is necessary and sufficient for a general (i.e., not necessarily injective) operator to have a closed range.},

This technique is based on an observer design where the data points are seen as the outputs of a constant velocity dynamical model. An explicit algorithm is given to efficiently compute this observer on the Grassmann manifold. This approach is compared to a particle filtering technique and similar results are obtained for a lower computational cost. Some extensions of the filter are also proposed.},

However, the direct implementation entails a complexity that is computationally intractable when the number of observations is large, especially when estimated with fully Bayesian methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. In this paper, we focus on a low-rank approximate Bayesian Gaussian processes, based on a basis function approximation via Laplace eigenfunctions for stationary covariance functions. The main contribution of this paper is a detailed analysis of the performance, and practical recommendations for how to select the number of basis functions and the boundary factor. Intuitive visualizations and recommendations, make it easier for users to improve approximation accuracy and computational performance. We also propose diagnostics for checking that the number of basis functions and the boundary factor are adequate given the data. The approach is simple and exhibits an attractive computational complexity due to its linear structure, and it is easy to implement in probabilistic programming frameworks. Several illustrative examples of the performance and applicability of the method in the probabilistic programming language Stan are presented together with the underlying Stan model code.},

In the latter area, PDE-based approaches interpret image data as discretizations of multivariate functions and the output of image processing algorithms as solutions to certain PDEs. Posing image processing problems in the infinite-dimensional setting provides powerful tools for their analysis and solution. For the last few decades, the reinterpretation of classical image processing problems through the PDE lens has been creating multiple celebrated approaches that benefit a vast area of tasks including image segmentation, denoising, registration, and reconstruction. In this paper, we establish a new PDE interpretation of a class of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) that are commonly used to learn from speech, image, and video data. Our interpretation includes convolution residual neural networks (ResNet), which are among the most promising approaches for tasks such as image classification having improved the state-of-the-art performance in prestigious benchmark challenges. Despite their recent successes, deep ResNets still face some critical challenges associated with their design, immense computational costs and memory requirements, and lack of understanding of their reasoning. Guided by well-established PDE theory, we derive three new ResNet architectures that fall into two new classes: parabolic and hyperbolic CNNs. We demonstrate how PDE theory can provide new insights and algorithms for deep learning and demonstrate the competitiveness of three new CNN architectures using numerical experiments.},

It is often impractical to expect a human with sufficient domain knowledge to be available to select the number of clusters/segments to return. We investigate techniques to determine the number of clusters or segments to return from hierarchical clustering and segmentation algorithms. We propose an efficient algorithm, the L method that finds the "knee" in a '\# of clusters vs. clustering evaluation metric' graph. Using the knee is well-known, but is not a particularly well-understood method to determine the number of clusters. We explore the feasibility of this method, and attempt to determine in which situations it will and will not work. We also compare the L method to existing methods based on the accuracy of the number of clusters that are determined and efficiency. Our results show favorable performance for these criteria compared to the existing methods that were evaluated.},

Adding to this picture, we show that several multistep methods of Nordsieck form can be recasted as Kalman filtering on q-times integrated Wiener processes. Doing so provides a family of IVP solvers that return a Gaussian posterior measure, rather than a point estimate. We show that some such methods have low computational overhead, nontrivial convergence order, and that the posterior has a calibrated concentration rate. Additionally, we suggest a step size adaptation algorithm which completes the proposed method to a practically useful implementation, which we experimentally evaluate using a representative set of standard codes in the DETEST benchmark set.},

Parametric, deterministic PDEs for the laws of the random solutions are derived. Representations of the random solutions' laws on infinite-dimensional parameter spaces in terms of 'generalized polynomial chaos' (GPC) series are established. Recent results on the regularity of solutions of these parametric PDEs are presented. Convergence rates of best N-term approximations, for adaptive stochastic Galerkin and collocation discretizations of the parametric, deterministic PDEs, are established. Sparse tensor products of hierarchical (multi-level) discretizations in physical space (and time), and GPC expansions in parameter space, are shown to converge at rates which are independent of the dimension of the parameter space. A convergence analysis of multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) discretizations of PDEs with random coefficients is presented. Sufficient conditions on the random inputs for superiority of sparse tensor discretizations over MLMC discretizations are established for linear elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs with random coefficients. \textcopyright{} 2011 Cambridge University Press.},

  abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics plays a key role in the design process across many industries. Recently, there has been increasing interest in data-driven methods in order to exploit the large volume of data generated by such computations. This paper introduces the idea of using spatially correlated polynomial ridge functions for rapid flowfield estimation. Dimension reducing ridge functions are obtained for numerous points within training flowfields. The functions can then be used to predict flow variables for new, previously unseen, flowfields. Their dimension reducing nature alleviates the problems associated with visualizing high-dimensional datasets, enabling improved understanding of design spaces and potentially providing valuable physical insights. The proposed framework is computationally efficient; consisting of either readily parallelizable tasks or linear algebra operations. To further reduce the computational cost, ridge functions need only be computed at a small number of subsampled locations. The flow physics encoded within covariance matrices obtained from the training flowfields can then be used to predict flow quantities, conditional upon those predicted by the ridge functions at the sampled points. To demonstrate the efficacy of the framework, the incompressible flow around an ensemble of airfoils is used as a test case. The ridge functions' predictive accuracy is found to be competitive with a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network. The local ridge functions can also be reused to obtain surrogate models for integral quantities, avoiding the need for long-term storage of the training data. Finally, use of the ridge framework with varying boundary conditions is demonstrated on a transonic wing.},

Two key results here will prove useful in studying the properties of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces: (a) that a linear operator on a Banach space is continuous if and only if it is bounded, and (b) that all continuous linear functionals on a Hilbert space arise from the inner product. The latter is often termed Riesz representation theorem. 2.1 Definitions of Banach and Hilbert spaces We will focus on real Banach and Hilbert spaces, which are, first of all, vector spaces 1 over the field R of real numbers. We remark that the theory remains valid in the context of complex Banach and Hilbert spaces, defined over the field C of complex numbers, modulo appropriately placed complex conjugates. In particular, the complex inner product satisfies conjugate symmetry instead of symmetry. Definition 1 (Norm). Let F be a vector space over R.

In this paper we begin by drawing parallels between ridge subspaces, sufficient dimension reduction and active subspaces, contrasting between techniques rooted in statistical regression and those rooted in approximation theory. This sets the stage for our new algorithm that approximates what we call a Gaussian ridge function---the posterior mean of a Gaussian process on a dimensionreducing subspace---suitable for both regression and approximation problems. To compute this subspace we develop an iterative algorithm that alternates between optimizing over the Stiefel manifold to compute the subspace and optimizing the hyperparameters of the Gaussian process. We demonstrate the utility of the algorithm on two analytical functions, where we obtain near exact ridge recovery, and a turbomachinery case study, where we compare the efficacy of our approach with three well-known sufficient dimension reduction methods: SIR, SAVE, and CR. The comparisons motivate the use of the posterior variance as a heuristic for identifying the suitability of a dimension-reducing subspace.},

Unlike the previous works that only provide estimates at the sample points, our approach directly estimates the gradient function, thus allows for a simple and principled out-of-sample extension. We provide theoretical results on the error bound of the estimator and discuss the bias-variance tradeoff in practice. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by applications to gradient-free Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and variational inference with implicit distributions. Finally, we discuss the intuition behind the estimator by drawing connections between the Nystr\textbackslash "om method and kernel PCA, which indicates that the estimator can automatically adapt to the geometry of the underlying distribution.},

The representation is based on expanding periodic covariance functions into a series of stochastic resonators. The explicit representation of the canonical periodic covariance function is written out and the expansion is shown to uniformly converge to the exact covariance function with a known convergence rate. The framework is generalized to quasi-periodic covariance functions by introducing damping terms in the system and applied to two sets of real data.

The method is based on an approximate series expansion of the covariance function in terms of an eigenfunction expansion of the Laplace operator in a compact subset of Rd. On this approximate eigenbasis, the eigenvalues of the covariance function can be expressed as simple functions of the spectral density of the Gaussian process, which allows the GP inference to be solved under a computational cost scaling as O(nm2) (initial) and O(m3) (hyperparameter learning) with m basis functions and n data points. Furthermore, the basis functions are independent of the parameters of the covariance function, which allows for very fast hyperparameter learning. The approach also allows for rigorous error analysis with Hilbert space theory, and we show that the approximation becomes exact when the size of the compact subset and the number of eigenfunctions go to infinity. We also show that the convergence rate of the truncation error is independent of the input dimensionality provided that the differentiability order of the covariance function increases appropriately, and for the squared exponential covariance function it is always bounded by {$\sim$} 1 / m regardless of the input dimensionality. The expansion generalizes to Hilbert spaces with an inner product which is defined as an integral over a specified input density. The method is compared to previously proposed methods theoretically and through empirical tests with simulated and real data.},

  abstract = {A Hilbert space embedding for probability measures has recently been proposed, with applications including dimensionality reduction, homogeneity testing, and independence testing. This embedding represents any probability measure as a mean element in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). A pseudometric on the space of probability measures can be defined as the distance between distribution embeddings: we denote this as {$\gamma$} k , indexed by the kernel function k that defines the inner product in the RKHS. We present three theoretical properties of {$\gamma$} k. First, we consider the question of determining the conditions on the kernel k for which {$\gamma$} k is a metric: such k are denoted characteristic kernels. Unlike pseudometrics, a metric is zero only when two distributions coincide, thus ensuring the RKHS embedding maps all distributions uniquely (i.e., the embedding is injective). While previously published conditions may apply only in restricted circumstances (e.g., on compact domains), and are difficult to check, our conditions are straightforward and intuitive: integrally strictly positive definite kernels are characteristic. Alternatively, if a bounded continuous kernel is translation-invariant on R d , then it is characteristic if and only if the support of its Fourier transform is the entire R d. Second, we show that the distance between distributions under {$\gamma$} k results from an interplay between the properties of the kernel and the distributions, by demonstrating that distributions are close in the embedding space when their differences occur at higher frequencies. Third, to understand the *. nature of the topology induced by {$\gamma$} k , we relate {$\gamma$} k to other popular metrics on probability measures, and present conditions on the kernel k under which {$\gamma$} k metrizes the weak topology.},

In particular we derive a simple sufficient condition for this parameter in the case of Gaussian RBF kernels. On the one hand our considerations are based on an investigation of an approximation property\textemdash the so-called universality\textemdash of the used kernels that ensures that all continuous functions can be approximated by certain kernel expressions. This approximation property also gives a new insight into the role of kernels in these and other algorithms. On the other hand the results are achieved by a precise study of the underlying optimization problems of the classifiers. Furthermore, we show consistency for the maximal margin classifier as well as for the soft margin SVM's in the presence of large margins. In this case it turns out that also constant regularization parameters ensure consistency for the soft margin SVM's.

Typically some form of regularization is required to ameliorate ill-posed behaviour. In this article we review the Bayesian approach to regularization, developing a function space viewpoint on the subject. This approach allows for a full characterization of all possible solutions, and their relative probabilities, whilst simultaneously forcing significant modelling issues to be addressed in a clear and precise fashion. Although expensive to implement, this approach is starting to lie within the range of the available computational resources in many application areas. It also allows for the quantification of uncertainty and risk, something which is increasingly demanded by these applications. Furthermore, the approach is conceptually important for the understanding of simpler, computationally expedient approaches to inverse problems. We demonstrate that, when formulated in a Bayesian fashion, a wide range of inverse problems share a common mathematical framework, and we highlight a theory of well-posedness which stems from this. The well-posedness theory provides the basis for a number of stability and approximation results which we describe. We also review a range of algorithmic approaches which are used when adopting the Bayesian approach to inverse problems. These include MCMC methods, filtering and the variational approach.},

  abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) constitutes a class of computational methods rooted in Bayesian statistics. In all model-based statistical inference, the likelihood function is of central importance, since it expresses the probability of the observed data under a particular statistical model, and thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of parameters and to choices among different models. For simple models, an analytical formula for the likelihood function can typically be derived. However, for more complex models, an analytical formula might be elusive or the likelihood function might be computationally very costly to evaluate. ABC methods bypass the evaluation of the likelihood function. In this way, ABC methods widen the realm of models for which statistical inference can be considered. ABC methods are mathematically well-founded, but they inevitably make assumptions and approximations whose impact needs to be carefully assessed. Furthermore, the wider application domain of ABC exacerbates the challenges of parameter estimation and model selection. ABC has rapidly gained popularity over the last years and in particular for the analysis of complex problems arising in biological sciences (e.g., in population genetics, ecology, epidemiology, and systems biology).},

  abstract = {While most classical approaches to Granger causality detection repose upon linear time series assumptions, many interactions in neuroscience and economics applications are nonlinear. We develop an approach to nonlinear Granger causality detection using multilayer perceptrons where the input to the network is the past time lags of all series and the output is the future value of a single series. A sufficient condition for Granger non-causality in this setting is that all of the outgoing weights of the input data, the past lags of a series, to the first hidden layer are zero. For estimation, we utilize a group lasso penalty to shrink groups of input weights to zero. We also propose a hierarchical penalty for simultaneous Granger causality and lag estimation. We validate our approach on simulated data from both a sparse linear autoregressive model and the sparse and nonlinear Lorenz-96 model.},

In the limit, this formulation coincides with the classical deterministic methods, which have been used as higher-order initial value problem solvers for over a century. Furthermore, the natural probabilistic framework provided by the GP formulation allows us to derive probabilistic versions of these methods, in the spirit of a number of other probabilistic ODE solvers presented in the recent literature [1, 2, 3, 4]. In contrast to higher-order Runge-Kutta methods, which require multiple intermediate function evaluations per step, Adams family methods make use of previous function evaluations , so that increased accuracy arising from a higher-order multistep approach comes at very little additional computational cost. We show that through a careful choice of covariance function for the GP, the posterior mean and standard deviation over the numerical solution can be made to exactly coincide with the value given by the deterministic method and its local truncation error respectively. We provide a rigorous proof of the convergence of these new methods, as well as an empirical investigation (up to fifth order) demonstrating their convergence rates in practice.},

This map is more commonly called the law of X, often denoted P X. Because X * P is itself a measure, we can naturally write X * P (B) = B d(X * P). We are now in a position to state a natural change of variable formulas (obviously we must do some work to prove that the equation holds; it conveniently does whenever the integrands are integrable) {$\Omega$} f \textbullet{} XdP = R f d(X * P). This is, of course, just the familiar law of the unconscious statistician: Ef (X) = {$\Omega$} f (X)dP = {$\infty$} -{$\infty$} f (x)d(X * P). Using this theorem with an indicator function, we can rewrite probabilities as expectations: P (X {$\in$} B) = B d(X * P) = {$\infty$} -{$\infty$} 1 x{$\in$}B d(X * P) = {$\Omega$} 1 X{$\in$}B dP = E1 X{$\in$}B .

This Radon-Nikodym derivative is more commonly referred to as the density of X; note the crucial requirement of absolute continuity which in this case (necessarily) exactly coincides with the existence of a density. By the chain rule, Ef (X) = {$\infty$} -{$\infty$} f (x)d(X * P) = {$\infty$} -{$\infty$} f (x) dX * P d\textmu{} d\textmu, P (X {$\in$} B) = {$\infty$} -{$\infty$} 1 x{$\in$}B d(X * P) = {$\infty$} -{$\infty$} 1 x{$\in$}B dX * P d\textmu{} d\textmu.},

Geodesic regression is a method for finding the relationship between a real-valued independent variable and a manifold-valued dependent random variable, where this relationship is modeled as a geodesic curve on the manifold. Least-squares estimation is formulated intrinsically as a minimization of the sum-of-squared geodesic distances of the data to the estimated model. Geodesic regression is a direct generalization of linear regression to the manifold setting, and it provides a simple parameterization of the estimated relationship as an initial point and velocity, analogous to the intercept and slope. A nonparametric permutation test for determining the significance of the trend is also given. For the case of symmetric spaces, two main theoretical results are established. First, conditions for existence and uniqueness of the least-squares problem are provided. Second, a maximum likelihood criteria is developed for a suitable definition of Gaussian errors on the manifold. While the method can be generally applied to data on any manifold, specific examples are given for a set of synthetically generated rotation data and an application to analyzing shape changes in the corpus callosum due to age.},

Kernels allow data to be mapped into high-dimensional feature spaces and can thus extend simple linear additive methods to nonlinear methods with higher order interactions. However, until recently, there has been a strong reliance on a limited class of stationary kernels such as the Mat\'ern or squared exponential, limiting the expressiveness of these modelling approaches. Recent machine learning research has focused on spectral representations to model arbitrary stationary kernels and introduced more general representations that include classes of nonstationary kernels. In this paper, we exploit the connections between Fourier feature representations, Gaussian processes and neural networks to generalise previous approaches and develop a simple and efficient framework to learn arbitrarily complex nonstationary kernel functions directly from the data, while taking care to avoid overfitting using state-of-the-art methods from deep learning. We highlight the very broad array of kernel classes that could be created within this framework. We apply this to a time series dataset and a remote sensing problem involving land surface temperature in Eastern Africa. We show that without increasing the computational or storage complexity, nonstationary kernels can be used to improve generalisation performance and provide more interpretable results.},

Unordered image-sets as samples from a finite-dimensional linear subspace naturally fall under this framework. We show that the study of inference over subspaces can be naturally cast as an inference problem on the Grassmann manifold. To perform recognition using subspace-based models, we need tools from the Riemannian geometry of the Grassmann manifold. This involves a study of the geometric properties of the space, appropriate definitions of Riemannian metrics, and definition of geodesics. Further, we derive statistical modeling of inter- and intra-class variations that respect the geometry of the space. We apply techniques such as intrinsic and extrinsic statistics, to enable maximum-likelihood classification.

Our probabilistic model explicitly incorporates a parametric PDE-based density and a trainable solution-to-parameter network while the introduced amortized variational family postulates a parameter-to-solution network, all of which are jointly trained. Furthermore, the proposed methodology does not require any expensive PDE solves and is physics-informed only at training time, which allows real-time emulation of PDEs and generation of inverse problem solutions after training, bypassing the need for FEM solve operations with comparable accuracy to FEM solutions. The proposed framework further allows for a seamless integration of observed data for solving inverse problems and building generative models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a nonlinear Poisson problem, elastic shells with complex 3D geometries, and integrating generic physics-informed neural networks (PINN) architectures.

A classifier with such a property is called calibrated.

We propose a Gaussian process model that directly links state derivative information with system observations , simplifying previous approaches and improving estimation accuracy.},

  abstract = {Parameter estimation for ODEs is an important topic in numerical analysis. In this paper, we present a novel approach to address this inverse problem that can be applied to differential equations that may include delay terms. Cross-entropy algorithms are general algorithms which can be applied to solve global optimization problems. The main steps of cross-entropy methods are first to generate a set of trial samples from a certain distribution and then to update the distribution based on these generated sample trials. To overcome the prohibitive computation of standard cross-entropy algorithms, we develop a modification combining local search techniques. The modified cross-entropy algorithm can improve the convergence rate and reduce the chances of converging to a local optimum. Two different coding schemes (continuous coding and discrete coding) are introduced (to represent the search space that we are optimizing over). Continuous coding uses a truncated multivariate Gaussian to generate trial samples, while discrete coding reduces the search space to consider only a finite (but relatively dense) subset of the feasible parameter values and uses a Bernoulli distribution to generate the trial samples (which are fixed point approximations to the parameters). Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the power and advantages of the proposed methods. Compared to other existing state-of-the-art approaches on some benchmark problems for parameter estimation, our methods have three main advantages: (1) they are robust to noise in the data to be fitted; (2) they are not sensitive to the number of observation points; and (3) the modified versions exhibit faster convergence without sacrificing accuracy.},

  abstract = {The interpretation of numerical methods, such as finite difference methods for differential equations, as point estimators suggests that formal uncertainty quantifica-tion can also be performed in this context. Competing statistical paradigms can be considered and Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods (PNMs) are obtained when Bayesian statistical principles are deployed. Bayesian PNM have the appealing property of being closed under composition, such that uncertainty due to different sources of discretisation in a numerical method can be jointly modelled and rigorously propagated. Despite recent attention, no exact Bayesian PNM for the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) has been proposed. This raises the fundamental question of whether exact Bayesian methods for (in general nonlinear) ODEs even exist. The purpose of this paper is to provide a positive answer for a limited class of ODE. To this end, we work at a foundational level, where a novel Bayesian PNM is proposed as a proof-of-concept. Our proposal is a synthesis of classical Lie group methods, to exploit underlying symmetries in the gradient field, and non-parametric regression in a transformed solution space for the ODE. The procedure is presented in detail for first and second order ODEs and relies on a certain strong technical condition existence of a solvable Lie algebra-being satisfied. Numerical illustrations are provided.},

  abstract = {Many quantities of interest (qois) arising from differential-equation-centric models can be resolved into functions of scalar fields. Examples of such qois include the lift over an airfoil or the displacement of a loaded structure; examples of corresponding fields are the static pressure field in a computational fluid dynamics solution, and the strain field in the finite element elasticity analysis. These scalar fields are evaluated at each node within a discretised computational domain. In certain scenarios, the field at a certain node is only weakly influenced by far-field perturbations; it is likely to be strongly governed by local perturbations, which in turn can be caused by uncertainties in the geometry. One can interpret this as a strong anisotropy of the field with respect to uncertainties in prescribed inputs. We exploit this notion of localised scalar-field influence for approximating global qois, which often are integrals of certain field quantities. We formalise our ideas by assigning ridge approximations for the field at select nodes. This embedded ridge approximation has favorable theoretical properties for approximating a global qoi in terms of the reduced number of computational evaluations required. Parallels are drawn between our proposed approach, active subspaces and vector-valued dimension reduction. Additionally, we study the ridge directions of adjacent nodes and devise algorithms that can recover field quantities at selected nodes, when storing the ridge profiles at a subset of nodes---paving the way for novel reduced order modeling strategies. Our paper offers analytical and simulation-based examples that expose different facets of embedded ridge approximations.},

  abstract = {Momentum strategies are an important part of alternative investments and are at the heart of commodity trading advisors (CTAs). These strategies have however been found to have difficulties adjusting to rapid changes in market conditions, such as during the 2020 market crash. In particular, immediately after momentum turning points, where a trend reverses from an uptrend (downtrend) to a downtrend (uptrend), time-series momentum (TSMOM) strategies are prone to making bad bets. To improve the response to regime change, we introduce a novel approach, where we insert an online change-point detection (CPD) module into a Deep Momentum Network (DMN) [1] pipeline, which uses an LSTM deep-learning architecture to simultaneously learn both trend estimation and position sizing. Furthermore, our model is able to optimise the way in which it balances 1) a slow momentum strategy which exploits persisting trends, but does not overreact to localised price moves, and 2) a fast meanreversion strategy regime by quickly flipping its position, then swapping it back again to exploit localised price moves. Our CPD module outputs a changepoint location and severity score, allowing our model to learn to respond to varying degrees of disequilibrium, or smaller and more localised changepoints, in a data driven manner. Using a portfolio of 50, liquid, continuous futures contracts over the period 1990\textendash 2020, the addition of the CPD module leads to an improvement in Sharpe ratio of 33\%. Even more notably, this module is especially beneficial in periods of significant nonstationarity, and in particular, over the most recent years tested (2015-2020) the performance boost is approximately 400\%. This is especially interesting as traditional momentum strategies have been underperforming in this period.},

  abstract = {Quantifying uncertainties in physical or engineering systems often requires a large number of simulations of the underlying computer models that are computationally intensive. Emulators or surrogate models are often used to accelerate the computation in such problems, and in this regard the Gaussian Process (GP) emulator is a popular choice for its ability to quantify the approximation error in the emulator itself. However, a major limitation of the GP emulator is that it can not handle problems of very high dimensions, which is often addressed with dimension reduction techniques. In this work we hope to address an issue that the models of interest are so complex that they admit different low dimensional structures in different parameter regimes. Building upon the active subspace method for dimension reduction, we propose a clustered active subspace method which identifies the local low-dimensional structures as well as the parameter regimes they are in (represented as clusters), and then construct low dimensional and local GP emulators within the clusters. Specifically we design a clustering method based on the gradient information to identify these clusters, and a local GP construction procedure to construct the GP emulator within a local cluster. With numerical examples, we demonstrate that the proposed method is effective when the underlying models are of complex low-dimensional structures.},

  abstract = {Machines of all kinds from vehicles to industrial equipment are increasingly instrumented with hundreds of sensors. Using such data to detect anomalous behaviour is critical for safety and efficient maintenance. However, anomalies occur rarely and with great variety in such systems, so there is often insufficient anomalous data to build reliable detectors. A standard approach to mitigate this problem is to use one class methods relying only on data from normal behaviour. Unfortunately, even these approaches are more likely to fail in the scenario of a dynamical system with manual control input(s). Normal behaviour in response to novel control input(s) might look very different to the learned detector which may be incorrectly detected as anomalous. In this paper, we address this issue by modelling time-series via Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) and utilising such an ODE model to simulate the behaviour of dynamical systems under varying control inputs. The available data is then augmented with data generated from the ODE, and the anomaly detector is retrained on this augmented dataset. Experiments demonstrate that ODE-augmented training data allows better coverage of possible control input(s) and results in learning more accurate distinctions between normal and anomalous behaviour in time-series.},

Local polynomial regression has received extensive attention for the non-parametric estimation of regression functions when both the response and the covariate are in Euclidean space. However, little has been done when the response is in a Riemannian manifold. We develop an intrinsic local polynomial regression estimate for the analysis of symmetric positive definite matrices as responses that lie in a Riemannian manifold with covariate in Euclidean space. The primary motivation and application of the methodology proposed is in computer vision and medical imaging. We examine two commonly used metrics, including the trace metric and the log-Euclidean metric on the space of symmetric positive definite matrices. For each metric, we develop a cross-validation bandwidth selection method, derive the asymptotic bias, variance and normality of the intrinsic local constant and local linear estimators, and compare their asymptotic mean-square errors. Simulation studies are further used to compare the estimators under the two metrics and to examine their finite sample performance. We use our method to detect diagnostic differences between diffusion tensors along fibre tracts in a study of human immunodeficiency virus.},

  abstract = {Subspace-valued functions arise in a wide range of problems, including parametric reduced order modeling (PROM). In PROM, each parameter point can be associated with a subspace, which is used for Petrov-Galerkin projections of large system matrices. Previous efforts to approximate such functions use interpolations on manifolds, which can be inaccurate and slow. To tackle this, we propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric model for subspace prediction: the Gaussian Process Subspace regression (GPS) model. This method is extrinsic and intrinsic at the same time: with multivariate Gaussian distributions on the Euclidean space, it induces a joint probability model on the Grassmann manifold, the set of fixed-dimensional subspaces. The GPS adopts a simple yet general correlation structure, and a principled approach for model selection. Its predictive distribution admits an analytical form, which allows for efficient subspace prediction over the parameter space. For PROM, the GPS provides a probabilistic prediction at a new parameter point that retains the accuracy of local reduced models, at a computational complexity that does not depend on system dimension, and thus is suitable for online computation. We give four numerical examples to compare our method to subspace interpolation, as well as two methods that interpolate local reduced models. Overall, GPS is the most data efficient, more computationally efficient than subspace interpolation, and gives smooth predictions with uncertainty quantification.},

  abstract = {Multilinear algebra kernel performance on modern massively-parallel systems is determined mainly by data movement. However, deriving data movement-optimal distributed schedules for programs with many high-dimensional inputs is a notoriously hard problem. State-of-the-art libraries rely on heuristics and often fall back to suboptimal tensor folding and BLAS calls. We present Deinsum, an automated framework for distributed multilinear algebra computations expressed in Einstein notation, based on rigorous mathematical tools to address this problem. Our framework automatically derives data movement-optimal tiling and generates corresponding distributed schedules, further optimizing the performance of local computations by increasing their arithmetic intensity. To show the benefits of our approach, we test it on two important tensor kernel classes: Matricized Tensor Times Khatri-Rao Products and Tensor Times Matrix chains. We show performance results and scaling on the Piz Daint supercomputer, with up to 19x speedup over state-of-the-art solutions on 512 nodes.},

  abstract = {In multiple change-point analysis, one of the major challenges is to estimate the number of change-points. Most existing approaches attempt to minimize a Schwarz information criterion which balances a term quantifying model fit with a penalization term accounting for model complexity that increases with the number of change-points and limits overfitting. However, different penalization terms are required to adapt to different contexts of multiple change-point problems and the optimal penalization magnitude usually varies from the model and error distribution. We propose a data-driven selection criterion that is applicable to most kinds of popular change-point detection methods, including binary segmentation and optimal partitioning algorithms. The key idea is to select the number of change-points that minimizes the squared prediction error, which measures the fit of a specified model for a new sample. We develop a cross-validation estimation scheme based on an order-preserved sample-splitting strategy, and establish its asymptotic selection consistency under some mild conditions. Effectiveness of the proposed selection criterion is demonstrated on a variety of numerical experiments and real-data examples.},
